      "Please pay attention better than I did to the reviews! This a very poor quality product. Will not stay in tune! If by chance you do order buy some better strings. The lesson booK is ok but that's about it. Do you self a favor and spend a little more. You will be glad you did! Great concept with great instructions and CDs.  The ukulele looks nice but the chords are frustratingly out of tune even with the strings tuned. I purchased this set, based on the reviews, as a gift for a young neice.  Rather than just giftwrapping the box, I took the uke out, tuned it, retuned it, stretched the strings, retuned it.  After 2 days, it would hold tune for about 3 minutes of playing (junk strings are probably to blame).  I did all this because my neice would be a beginner and therefore be easily frustrated by an instrument that would not hold tune.  Next I went to a \"learn to play\" site on the net and found C Am F G7 chord diagrams and started to attempt to play.  The strings were so high off the fretboard that any note fingered above the 3rd fret would pull the string out of tune.  The easy chords were difficult because the high strings got in the way of my fingers so that I could not finger a chord cleanly.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the intonation and tuning problems, I was not willing to give this instrument to my neice, so next I went to a local music store to see if a set of strings and some shaving of the saddle (the white peice on the bridge that the strings rest on) would make it playable.  In order to gain a frame of reference, I picked up a $78 uke and strummed my newly learned chords.  It sounded and played great!  I told the music store guy that I wanted this uke to play like the $78 one.  He said the the cost would equal the original cost and still might not produce a good instrument.  Then he showed me a $40 instrument, an entry level uke from  Kala or Lanakai.  It played like the more expensive one, but didn't have the pretty binding, etc.  I loved it and bought it.  When I got home I called for an RMA and will send the much inferior Firebrand uke with all the books and cd's back to the seller.  The sellers were nice and seemed concerned about selling an unplayable instrument.  It's too close to Christmas to waste time on this one.  Hope this helps you out. did not like..sent back for refund I wanted to love this product so badly and debated tirelessly over purchasing or not... DO NOT BUY THIS!  It is cheaply made, would only play correctly for about two key changes and slipped out of place, And never could get it to fit my 3/4 size guitar right like my research of the company's website said it would.  I immeadiately sent back and got a refund!  I was so disappointed! do not waste your money it's not near what it's made out to be a waste of time money and any effort put into ordering it and im disapointed in amazon for allowing it to be sold on there web site there able to check reviews to see if a item is worthy of being sold on your web site don't waste your time getting this. is made out of cheap stuff. does not teach you anything on how to play guitar saw it on shark tank thinking it would be good but was i fooled recib una referencia diferente a la comprada por lo cual no cumpli con la satisfaccin del cliente sin embrago me retornaron el excedente It seems to me everyone got exceptional instrument except me.  I don't understand what's so great about this guitar.  Action is just horrible.  I mean, look at 12 fret its 10 millimeters.  I don't know much about classical but it is not what I would call great playability.  Of course, you can play on this guitar, I do.  But it's hard.  I suppose, one shouldn't expect much from $100 dollars instrument.  But I repeat, it's not great.  Now about bass strings.  They sound bassy, as I suppose, they must.  But the thing is their bassines overpower trebles. Trebles sound unproportionally weak. And yes, yes.  I did changed strings on a good ones (D-Adario normal tension something) upon getting this guitar from Amazon  I should say though that guitar starts to sound much better now than it was when I just got it.  But action on this instrument still kills my fingers.  I do finger pushups in order to develop muscle on my phalanges, in order, to play on this guitar somehow.  Of course, I could ask professional to fix bridge nut, but why would I do it for such cheap guitar.  My verdict-unless you want to develop your fingers, in order, to pull out nail with your bare hands, go for it.  I will send it back, and buy myself inexpensive Spanish brand. If you read this it means you in the same point where I had been some time ago and I hope my advise will help you as much as the same advise had helped to me.\n",

      "Essentially it is pointless to discuss some hypothetic \"classical guitar\" on the web. In the same way as all we, people, have the same hands, legs and heads but have different nature and voices, the guitars, even of the same model of the same manufacturer may differ wildly.\n",

      "First of all buy the real Spanish guitar. I mean Spanish made in Span not the \"Spanish\" made in China or anywhere else. Spanish guitars, even the cheapest made toward sound, not toward look. Do not buy guitar with laminated top, it will sound as a toilet sitting and you never will be able to get decent sound out of it. The quality of sound is very important while playing classical guitar and you produce the sound with your hands. It is crucially important to learn to produce right sound by positioning fingers and nails properly: you will never learn it with cheap, not authentic guitar, because it will sound the same whatever you will try! It is like a car that make only left turn. Then you will try to play the real guitar not the bogus one , you will find youself incapable to make it sound as other players do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not try to choose guitar yourself because you can't produce any reasonable judgment until you will learn how to make it sound properly, you must take someone who actually knows how to play classical guitar. You have to get  a decent instrument because you MUST fall in love with the sound of one, otherwise it is pointless: you play guitar because it fascinates you esthetically. I doubt that toilet sitting sound out of shipping box that pretends to produce music will fascinate you!\n",

      "3. Buy Spanish guitar from Spanish manufacturer, they start as low as $250, roughly. Doesn't work and seller won't accept a return. useless for guitar amp Cable stop working after a month, bogus cable. Horrible, stiff cables that are more or less locked in the position they came in. Other Hosa cables have more flex to them, which is what I was expecting here. Seriously, stiff cables are the worst. These things just do not last... Mega Cheap imported cables from China. The connectors are flimsy nickle finish - will oxidize in time. This product has a sticker in the back that says \"California Proposition 65 Warning. This product may contain chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm\".\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't care how good the cable is if it's capable of causing cancer to you... Not stereo.  This adapter delivers a MONO signal from a stereo AT microphone to the recorder or camera. Packaging says it's ideal for connecting a mic to a stereo recorder of camera but it's only ideal if you want MONO sound from your STEREO mic. Got it to use it on a microphone mounted on a camera it only has noise I do not recommend it cheap and useless never got it to worck the 1/4 jack plug is a bit narrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "I purchased two of these to connect my studio monitors to my mixer.. I have a large range of 1/4 cables and have never had a problem but the diameter of the 1/4 plug on these cables is simply to small.... they are not a tight fit into the socket and the sound can cut in/out.\n",

      "of course..i had already thrown away the packaging...........sigh I bought two of these.  They're ok, but the rubber boot on both the cords keeps popping out of the metal housing.  They are not secured at all, making me believe the product is of substandard quality.  Not too hip on the angle either or the metal color.\n",
      "\n",
      " If it were painted black, the boots didn't pop out all the time, and the 3.5 was strait, that would have been what I would have liked them to be.  They look kind of ugly. Seriously....when am I going to just spend the 25$ for a good chord instead of being upset by buying all of these cheap ones??  Straight out the box the jacks were bad, messing with my tone and volume if they turned or moved the wrong way.  Seriously terrible cable, but super inexpensive sooooo.....still bad cable. the cable hisses, crackles and pops right out of the package.  save your money and buy a better cable.  i will buy cables locally from now on so i can easily return them if they are defective.  i would definitely not buy this product again or recommend it to anyone else. very light use, here and there - now crackles BADLY and into the trash it goes - NOT recommended!! Returned it, very noisy cable. i bought this item about 3 months ago and have used it about 5 times..it gave up on me today completely.  i did not abuse or take it anywhere but used it a few times to play a few songs...no static noise or anything.... Didn't work out of the box.  The end connectors were loose and the cables are thin.  No sound from the guitar.  Other cables work. Spend a few dollars and get a reputable brand.  Glad I didn't bring these to a gig. Luckily I can return easily with Amazon. a little upset, because after one use and delicate handling, it no longer works. It did not even leave my studio, I will be inspecting it a little closer to see if can be repaired, I will do a follow up review. junk fall apart in your hand Does not work. This cable showed up on my doorstep and let me down right away. Within the first few days it cracked and popped and was put in the \"crap\" pile in storage. These cables are poorly constructed and just not worth the money at all. Pay a little more for something that works and lasts. This happened (check out my picture) in about 3 to 6 months of use. I guess you by cheap, you get cheap results. Cables do not connect effective enough to give a great sound. Connection is weak. the sound is really bad, wondering if I had a defective cable , for the price I not even bother to return. Unfortunately this switch creates a large pop when switch on or off. For a DJ or game announcer it is entirely unacceptable to have a big pop every time the mic mutes or un-mutes. It would have only added a very small margin to have done this right. The engineer in me wanted to take it apart and add a resister and cap to fix the problem. I chose to return it. I'm a pro-cheapo and I hated this thing. They're noisy, and the cables feel really cheap, gummy-like. Drop few more bucks and get something else! Already broke? within a month of having this cable? maybe I got a lemon, but it seems like these things are not durable. The cable didn't break in half, but there's static and the signal is not going through. Worked in the beginning though. Bummer to post a bad review but that's what happened. No low end. Did not work. After I asked for a refund, Amazon told me I could just dispose of it. Threw it in the trash that moment! Don't waste your money on this thing. Awesome idea, broke within a week :( I had to turn the volume way way up when I use this to the point of loss of fidelity. Does not work good Plugged it into a xlr mic and got nothing but really bad feedback noise. had to cut the new cord and use a guitar jack i already had that works fine. not worth returning for 7 bucks but i did pay 10 for overnight shipping.\n",

      "throw it in the trash and forget about it. Blehhhhh Didn't work for me, wasn't what I thought it was used for. So I ordered the right adapter for my purposes. Didn't work. Does not send stereo signal through, only mono. Useless. Sent it back, it didn't suit my purposes. This is an absolutely terrible wire! Do not purchase! I am a musician and needed a cable to connect an instrument to a PA (sound system) that was 1/8 to a 1/4 and this did not pick up the bass at all and the volume was very low with a poor signal. My friend connected it from his phone to the PA as well and it was as if it was going through a $2 speaker, very muffled, terrible sound quality. I don't understand these other reviews that were good!!! Please do not make this mistake!!! The worst XLR adaptor I have ever seen or used  -  won't stay locked in place . This makes the 5th and the last Hosa I will ever buy only two wire and power is shorted to ground not a good idea to use this Packaging has been damaged, cable was not quality, have not heard one side, did not have the proper sound, this is a very bad cable. Didn't work; I had to connect a female jack via female-to-male adapter to connect to my amp. Was product tested at factory before shipping? Pure crap. Two failed the first night. I threw them all away. This unit worked once, then it was all static, all the time (except when turned off).  I tried different batteries and no luck.  Apparently defective. I tried it with Audacity on my desk to record my pod-casts and with my Kodak Zi8.  Both pretty weak.  I recorded someone talking with the zi8 as a test.  First with the sony mic and then without it.  First with mic sensitivity levels at normal and then again at max.  The Sony produced much more hiss and was nowhere near the sensitivity of the Zi8's internal mic.  The zi8's mic picked up so much more ambient noise and the voices were so much more robust.  Was really surprised to hear all the positive reviews with the Zi8. I tried this mic and it was terrible. The volume was very low, when you try to increase the volume you get a lot of white noise. Save your money, don't buy this product. I wish i could give it half of a star. These would not work in any city I visited, there was constant static. Amazing! When you open the box, you are greeted with WM-Pros not WLX-Pros. It's printed right on the modules!\n",

      "(((((((Customers Beware))))))) Very Disappointed with this microphone. Admittedly I didn't expect much, but it's even worse - in fact it's not usable. Do NOT buy this microphone. I was looking for an omni-directional microphone and this seemed to be my only inexpensive option. I was hoping that Pyle would make an inexpensive omni, but I couldn't find one. I do like their directional mike the PDMIC58 which is very good. This microphone is going in the trash. My mistake I did not read the reviews.  I needed this for a play my daughter has a part in and the sound equipment we have needed a microphone.  We were on a budget and well I should have saved my money.  I can use this to hear things like a head phone if I want to hold it up to my ear and listen like a headset but cannot get the sound to come out on any sound system I have used and I have 4 different ones that I maxed the volume out on with no luck.  Very disappointed in this particular Sony product... This guitar initially was perfect for my granddaughter, even her professional instructor thought it was a nice instrument. Fast forward a couple of months, the neck has developed a convex bow making it completely unplayable. I've taken it to a guitar technician for inspection and he declared it is unrepairable due to the neck bow, and it is a manufacturer defect.\n",
      "Amazon is usually good about returning defective items for me, but in this case the response was \"out of warranty\" and I'm just left with a worthless guitar that I paid $145 for.\n",
      "Shame on Amazon, I've done a lot of business with them and this is not acceptable to me or anyone that works hard for their money.\n",
      "I'm disappointed and understandably frustrated, and my granddaughter can't continue with her lessons.. I borrowed my friends guitar in order to get my nephew to play.  It is junk.  With new strings, it still sounds lousy.  The tuning machines are poor quality, one of the pegs keeps popping out, and the action is lousy (like any guitar comes out of the box unfortunately).  I have had several guitars.  While it is possible to buy a $130 guitar that is o-kaaay, you still need a luthier to set it up.  In my opinion you get what you pay for and there is a reason that Martins and Gibsons cost over $2000 for a decent instrument.  That aside, for kids starting out I would avoid this piece of junk and get something better, even an Epiphone maybe. RETURNED ALSO WITH KEY BOARD cheep  not buy this mic This thing worked the first time I plugged it in, but it hadn't worked since! It seems to be well constructed...don't be fooled! Unfortunatey started trying to use it after the return period thinking it would be fine...and discovered that something is very wrong with the mic that I received...  It is way too muddy...and worse than my cheap AudioTechnica Pro 4L...  What gives???  Did I get a knock-off that I was assured of not getting??? This is not original product. I'm not satisfied.  Too late to return :( You're buying a brand, not a quality microphone. This isn't the Shure of the olden days. This is poorly manufacturer, dull sounding, and un-durable junk. Go with Seinheiser or EV, save yourself the headache. Sad but true, Shure isn't what it used to be. This is junk. I ordered this the same day I ordered a guitar from Guitar Center, If you see \"Email for availability\" on a web page you are ordering from that means its back ordered. After 20 days of waiting they sent an email stating it was going to be another 30 days. I shopped real stores and bought a beautiful Stratocaster.  BUT by that time my 30 day warranty was up and the M-Audio bearly functions. The head phone jack has to be pulled out in just this special place to work; the USB connection  crackles and cuts out completely sometimes.  My musician friends are back in town and say Line 6 is better.  No matter I'm very happy to be playing again.  The delay gave me time to realize I needed good instrument that is a joy to play and I got this sweet Fender instead of the 150 buck bargain. Oh! the M-Audio was a refurbish...NO bargain This lasted a few weeks and shorted out. I really did not expect a super high quality cable but I did expect it to last for a few months at least.  I used it twice (regular plug it in and sing kind of use, I am not swinging from it or using it as a lasso...) and now it works intermittently at best.  I bought a more expensive cable at a local music store to ensure the issue was indeed this cable and not my mic or amp.  Save your $$ and buy something else. These things are terrible. One wouldn't fit in my soundboard, another wouldn't lock in my mic. Plain and simple....if your looking for crap that doesn't work....buy this. Received it in time, standard blister packaging but the cable stopped working after 45 days. Since I was out of 30 days return time, sent an email to the manufacturer but no response till today. Deal or not, if you are serious... you do not buy a guitar in this price range.  And I do not mean serious in terms of wanting to really be a pro guitarist... I just mean, if you are serious in trying to learn guitar... do not.  These things are always overly cheap and unplayable.  I have a few cheap models of Silvertone guitars that are for display purposes only (signed by artists) and, trust me, as a guitarist who owns many guitars, I cant even play these things. They are so cheap, the strings do not stay in tune, usually have intonation problems (cant clear frets and thus buzz and pop or never have proper note frequences at all the frets).  They usually always feel cheap too and the feel does affect the playability and tone.  If you want to really learn you have to pay at least a little more and go for better brands.  I would recommend anyone serious in learning to never buy a guitar that costs under $300... you are just wasting your money and the problems and limitations may even frustrate you and work against you learning how to play.  Go for the brands that are made by the bigger dogs... like ESP's LTD brand... Gibson's Epiphone brand, or Fender's lower brand (Squire?).  There are other examples.  I am sure Ibanez has some good lower models (though I am not sure they have a lower brand name for their cheaper gear).  If you do have to go for a cheaper brand, at least then buy their top of the line models (this pertains to Dean, for example).  But for me, brands like Silvertone and Archer... are just plain no good for real use. Junk, right out of the box.  The neck was warped, among other things.  Spend a few extra dollars and but a reputable brand. Not satisfied the product did not work. The sound keeps cracking. People, I don't understand  you. I run a studio, I do record vocals, I mix, I don't do masters. The quality of sound coming out of this headset, is simply horribe. Are you kidding me? Sounds like an empty can. I got them from Guitar Center based on recommendation. I've took them back within 2 days. I couldn't  believe  anyone  would write a good review for this. Your standards  must be super low. If anyone cares I still believe the best you can use in studio would be either SONY MDRV6, or SONY MDR2509HD. the rest are just toys. mine broke after 1 week - lost the center part of the stereo image.  Will be returning.  Sounded great until then tho! I used these headphones in my small guitar studio for a very short time. Headphones are a useful tool for guitarists when trying to learn solos by ear. These headphones are useless for this particular application. They are mushy with little definition and they clip easily,  even when pulling out the lower frequencies and operating at a reasonable volume. I ended up giving them to my 18 year old daughter hoping that she would have better luck than I. Eventually I ended up going with the Audio-Technica ATH-M40x and I couldn't be happier. More of a design thing but not for vocal recording you can clearly hear the sound coming out of these right in your mic. I've owned and used AKG K240s (and the discontinued K240DF) for more than a decade.  The quality of the product has fallen CONSIDERABLY since manufacturing moved to China.  To be truthful, this was never a particularly durable headset, but the old models made in Europe were head and shoulders above what AKG is shipping now.  They feel flimsy coming out of the box, and the product I received has a poor solder connection internally that makes the right channel audio cut out when you turn your head.  The plastic ear cup is already partially cracked and I've used them for just two months in studio.  The ear padding isn't as soft or comfortable as the old model, either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sonically, they are everything I'd like my headphones to be, but that doesn't matter when I can only hear in one ear. I won't be buying AKG headphones again in the near future. I received two of these speaker, but one didn't work. Unfortunately, it's been quite a pain for me to have the item returned due to the return policy for this item reason why I'm just rating it one star. The locking mechanism failed and the guitar fell. Lifetime warranty my booty. They said that since I left my guitar on there overnight and for awhile then it's not covered. It's only meant to be used temporarily like on stage. C'mon now. I guess the locking mechanism is a failure point and that is their canned line. Anyways look at the angles of the legs, that's pretty poor engineering if you understand stability. Alas, it was the only one at the time that would fit my V. When it worked it was good, but not worth having your guitar take a dump. The under-guitar support arms stick out too far for a solid-body instrument.\n",
      "The cord tends to get tangled on them. This guitar stand was one of the better options compared to the cheapy stands you can buy. I don't gig with my stand, it simply sits in my practice space and holds my guitar. After owning the stand for about a year out of nowhere one of the front legs gave out and my G&L hit the floor. After inspection the plastic locking mechanism simply broke just from the constant weight of the guitar hanging on it. I contacted Ultimate and they sent me out a replacement locking mechanism and I drilled out the rivet and replaced. Worked fine for 4 months and the exact same thing happened but this time I was simply hanging the guitar and the leg gave out so my Legacy didn't hit the floor. Called Ultimate again and they are now sending me a complete new stand. Still not satisfied with the safety of my guitar on this stand old or new I again took apart the old stand and cut a piece of metal pipe ( top rail pipe of chain link fence fit perfect ) that fits super tight in the bottom hole for the locking mechanism and simply made it to where the stand will no longer collapse for transport. I really like the stand but I will no longer trust Ultimate with the safety of my instruments with the way it is manufactured. After only 3 months of use, one of the stands no longer supports my JBL SXR speaker. It just slides down to the lowest, unextended position within a matter of 20-30 seconds. Will be seeking warranty service but will sell immediately afterwards. I had my old On-Stage stands for 5 years, and although they weren't as nice looking or as promising as these Ultimates, they were always functional. Will buy another pair of On-Stage stands (and for much less too). Also, the Ultimate bag that holds a pair of these stands didn't fare so well in the 3 months either. Already holes and small nicks throughout. Disappointed. The tremolo effect can barely be heard! I tested this in every spot of the pedalboard, and even with the depth all the way up it's barely noticeable.\n",
      "If you want a great Tremolo for the same price, get the Donner Golden Tremolo. It's sturdier, smaller, and actually can be heard. I bought these for my wonderful Yamaha FG700s. I play every day and was hoping to give some rest to my fingers and try the softer tone of nylon strings.\n",
      "I was happy to have found nylon strings that, according to the description, could be used in acoustic guitars for steel strings (hey! they even come with ball ends!). I was hopeful that these \"high tension\" would work well but either way decided to be EXTREMELY careful when tuning the strings.  I was almost successful, until the E string snapped (of course had to be that one!). Complete frustration and complete waste of money! Back to my reliable steel strings.\n",
      "Please do not waste your money and time. While the pedal is flexible and has a few modes, I just couldn't handle the digital artifacts and synthetic sound. If you want a simple clean 1 octave down reproduction of your signal, this is NOT your pedal. Bad action, fret buzz, cheap hardware,  faulty toggle switch, crap plastic nut not cut properly, loose strap holders, loose cheap tuners, shall I go on? i tried this and did not noticed much improvement in any of my guitar sound. Had a good sound and seemed to be well made until mine stopped working after about a month of minimal use (I never even got to use it live). Ended up with a Vox Wah thats been working like the day a bought it four years ago. This isn' the first Dunlop product I've had that stopped working on me, and I have since lost faith in the company and have not bought anything from them in about 6 years (Although I hear they own MXR now). I suggest you keep your reciept/get a warranty. Strings are over rated. Had to immediately replace them. For some reason they did not work well on my Fender guitar I played in a band with a guy who used this as his main guitar for YEARS. He would spend up to 10 minutes of a 40 minute set tuning. He put a new bridge and locking tuners on it, and bought a boss pedal tuner. It still could not be properly intonated after hours of adjustment. He had a deep emotional attatchment to it because of the person who gave it to him, and we couldn't really ask him to get rid of it. We once spent 3 hours in a studio attempting to tune and adjust this guitar. He ended up using my guitar for the rest of the session. It was a happy day for us when it was stolen.\n",
      "Before you buy this guitar please consider the possibility that it might have improperly dried neck wood, a badly cut neck pocket and a poorly cut nut. Seems like a simple concept, hold up two layers of nylon between you and the mic, how hard could that be? Get used to being half way thru recording just to have to stop because the arm slips and falls away from the mic. As others here have said, this thing is way too big.  I got a medium, and have small hands, and I'm not sending this back for a small, because frankly, I'm done.  Go in a store and try them on is my advice.  I have others that fit fine.  I wanted the whole Coricidin bottle thing but this isn't worth it, and for me at least is unusable. Vater sticks are computer matched by pitch and weight AT the factory. For some reason, somebody between Vater and the UPS person who received the shipment (I'm looking at you, AMAZON) decided to un-pair the sticks from their Vater sleeves, then repackage them in a long, plastic sleeve with the Vater sleeve folded up next to the sticks in the baggie. I could tell when I opened the box that it wasn't going to be right, and as soon as I held them in my hands, I knew they were different weights. Visual inspection showed one stick obviously longer than the other, and if you look at the photo of the butt-end of the sticks along the ruler, you can see that the cuts are at different points of the curvature. There was a difference of 6 grams between the sticks. I've uploaded photos of the initial shipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In all fairness, this is the first time I've ever had this problem ordering sticks through Amazon. I've got 7 other pairs that were just fine before this - two of which were Vater sticks (Power 5B Sugar Maple Wood & Xtreme Design XD-5B Wood).\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as Vater sticks when they aren't tampered with from the factory - great products. I've got the Power 5B Sugar Maple Wood Tip sticks already, and the size is great, I just need something a little sturdier when I'm on an acoustic set. These would have been perfect had they been a properly matched set.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm giving this product one star based on a hair-brained decision to un-pair and repackage the sticks somewhere along Amazon's distribution line. Poor quality. The capo is to tight and causes strings to sound sharp.  The metal spring broke after three months.  Do not buy. This guitar had the worst tuning pegs I have ever seen. Guitar would not stay in tune even for 1 song. I tried a heavier gauge string but they were no better. Might be a decent instrument if you put on a set of tuning pegs but I didn't want to bother. Returned it. This capo is not acceptable for acoustic guitars with low tension, as the clamping force is so tight that it bends the strings up. I would recommend getting an easily adjustable capo instead for much more versatility for the same price. I have seen the videos about adjusting this capo, and I am a 200 pound male who lifts weights daily and it hurt my hand and took a very long time to pull the capo looser. Even then, the tension was not equal across all strings. I would much rather turn a knob than gorilla force this into a suitable position. Pops off all of the time, way too big. Save your money and get the esp ltd ec-10! It has two high output pickups and a satan finish. Its also way more comfortable to play. Seriously - it has a hard time holding it's own weight / shape. I thought it'd be a lot stronger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely not one of my proudest Amazon purchases. Too much effort to return it however. Beware the tension.  It's extreme and can mar the back of the neck or even fingerboard.  Finctionally it can also throw off the tuning because of the tightness.  It's also huge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Go with an manually adjustable unit which is what pros universally recommend--a Shubb or Planet Waves NS. This is a simple product and fairly easy to setup/use.\n",
      "But, one of the washers was severely bent, quality seems to be lacking, sadly. I had to return it because it wouldn't go completely over my finger.  I couldn't even get it to sit on my first knuckle.  Will have to order a custom size.  It felt like stoneware too, which gave me the heebie jeebies. This does work, but its not a real Keyser capo. When it arrived i compared it to my other keyser of the same shape.\n",
      "1. This label is Rights Reserved, like on the real one.\n",
      "2. There are no grooves or textured handle like on the real Keyser.\n",
      "\n",
      "I dislike when being charged for something of a brand u rely on. Only to discover its a fake. It dishonest and uses the reputation that took the Keyser Co. time to build. Just aint right. I'll buy mine at the guitar store now.\n",
      "Ive added a photo, the top is legit. Horrible strings! No Tone at all! I bought D'Addaria and Gibson. No comparison. Despite Martin being so cheap in price and quality, it's no wonder that D'Addario is eating their lunch. Given the choice low cheap Gibson guitars and high end American made guitars, Gibson looks like a has been in the making. These were on sale half price, when I got them they were open and the screws and lock washers were missing.  Someone apparently had installed the buttons on their guitars then sent back the locks.  I sent them back and got a quick refund then bought some Fender Strap Blocks.  They are just rubber washers that stretch to fit over the strap holder behind the strap.  Much cheaper and fit any guitar without having to drill and install new strap buttons, and they work great.  Save your money. The capo I received has a shallow and short gripping ability.  It barely fit on my parlor guitar in depth and width and would not fit at all on my Ovation A/E guitar, neither of which has a very deep or wide neck.  Additionally, I found it to be difficult to grasp and open.  I threw it in the trash. Never buy this. 10x better pedals for the money (See boss ds-2 or pro-co rat). I have this pedal (It was given to me) and I never use it. Don't listen to good reviews. Meh... sent it back, had better. The goose neck on this thing is so weak that it never stays in place.  I thought this thing did a good job of keeping the wind down so the p's didn't pop and the s's weren't too shrill, but I eventually bought a BSW metal windscreen and then I realized just how much better the sound could have been.  This thing is trash. It's been a while since I bought this. it worked great but 2 years after it decided not to work Took FOREVER to arrive. Looked great. Then too difficult for my 13 year old son to use. Negative 5 stars; The button shafts stick out too far, they feel cheap and once you slip the strap button into the shaft on the guitar it has to make a \"click\"  sound, then you have to yank on it to make sure its on. I forgot to yank on it ONE TIME, played a few mins, let go of the guitar, it fell and hit the edge of a nearby chair and cracked the face of the electronic cavity, broke knobs switches and pots, completely wrecking one of the best axes I'll ever own. Dunlop said warranty only covers defective workmanship and not \"damage due to misuse\"!!?? How about damage from a shittty design that was supposed to protect against what it caused??!!!  No more Dunlop products EVER AGAIN!!!! Dimarzio Cliplock Strap pisses all over Craploks! Not suitable for a 61 key synth - although that's clearly in the description.  I had my suspicions, bought it anyway - I was right to be suspicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Put it on two different 61 key synths (prophet 12 and old yamaha cs1x) and it's about as \"snug\" as a black trash bag on your computer monitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "I pulled the strings as far as they would go and it's still a saggy mess - then you end up with 2 feet of cord.  I'll hold on to it for use with any 76 key I might encounter, but totally worthless for something smaller.  It is decent material - but you're better off covering your 61 key with a towel than this thing. Shattered the first time I tried to attach it to a snare drum rim.  On stage, in a big hurry, disappointed. Noisy, takes 2 hands, I rather my cheap pawn shop cable huge untir. heavy, bulky and won't stay where it is clamped. frustrated. sits in closet. don't waste your money and all!! A nice enough cable, BUT it slips out of the input jack on my electric piano. I've never had any other cables do this, so I'm pretty sure it's the cable and not the jack (also, I see other reviewers have occasionally noticed similar things). It's slipped out a few times in the middle of gigs, so I'm going to try to get my money back, but my hopes are not high! Cable switch doesn't work at all.  Appears to have a short straight out of the package.  Getting loud static that cuts in and out every few seconds.  This is a deal breaker! wind screen is way too big its bulky and to me useless, the screen came out, was thinking of glueing it back in but went to ebay and bought 2 metal mesh pop filters cheaper that is MUCH better...avoid this!! These came stock on my Jackson Kelly KEXMG. All the other guitars I own have Schaller buttons on them and I have one main strap I use for all of the guitars. I figured since the guitar came with them I would try them out. Not twenty min later I was removing them and putting Schaller buttons in their place. Here the 3 major reasons I did not like them over Schaller:\n",
      "1- Bulky. They stick out too far and on any guitar with a strap button on the back it jabs you in the stomach or below!\n",
      "2- Problems engaging. I would push them into the receiver and they pop back out. It wasn't until I forced them in while pushing the button that they went in a stayed in. Schallers click in and you know they are ready to go.\n",
      "3- Cheap. They just feel cheap. Thin metal is used in comparison to the Schallers; which have a very heavy and solid feel to them.\n",
      "For a few bucks more I'll stick with Schaller's. I have been using them for 10+ years and have never seen one fail. Not sure what happened. I've owned these before and found them reasonably functional, at least when considering convenience and cost. BUT this last one had a SOOOO MUCH spring tension that my 11 year old couldn't even use it. The compression on the strings was so extreme that it made the guitar (every guitar) play sharp. It's fine for pkaying solo, but you can't use it for a key change on one instrument and play with another properly tuned instrument (which is kind of the point). I'm also concerned about what it would do to frets after prolonged use. I pretty much limit it's purpose for repair and maintenance work when I need to make adjustments to something but don't want to restring the guitar.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recommend stearing clear from these entirely. Cheap junk! I would not recommend this to anyone.\n",

      "Do not do what a pop filter is supposed to.\n",

      "Please do not waste your money. very very slow delivery. not happy I love Ernie Ball and I've been a regular user over the years.\n",
      "I was so negatively surprisde by the fact that there were some coating defects on the first string.\n",
      "This is simply not acceptable.\n",
      "I'll take my chances with D'addario I own a '84 Martin D-12-28 and a '03 Martin J12-16GT guitars. This has to be the worst capo on the market for a 12 string guitar especially Martin 12 string guitars because of their wider necks. What I noted about this capo is that it notoriously knocks the guitar out of tune 9 out of 10 times. You cannot have that performing live. Absolutely not. I would not recommend this to anyone especially Martin owners to not buy this. Spring for the G7 guitar capo instead. More pricey? Yes. But well worth the money spent. I purchased this after reading the great reviews but like a few of the comments that are on here lately this thing is not good. Looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless. Does not come even close to being able to hold up the weight of the filter. I would have returned it but I completely destroyed the package getting it open (which oddly had staples holding it closed). Looks cool.. but awkward it is upside down compared to the jim dunlop which I find much easier to use I bought an Ephiphone Les Paul Tribute Plus and this case was included with the guitar. It will protect your guitar around the house and going to practice. The quality is exceptionally poor. The cover is soft and tears really easy even with a gentle bump. The trim that covers the seam on the outside fabric was loose on mine and soon to fall off. Epiphone sent me a replacement case and it was just as bad as the first. I bought a Gator abs case and while it is not a flight case, is much more durable than this case.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was \"free\" with the Tribute, but it just makes me question the quality standards of Epiphone - although the Tribute Plus could not be a nicer, better made guitar. Very muddy tone. Not good for metal Don't even bother w this pedal, it sounds like balls.. Here's the deal with this pedal. It is inexpensive and you can get a better pedal with barely a bit more money and sometimes a little less money. In my opinion, for spending less than $100 for a distortion pedal, whether it is your first pedal or 700th pedal, a few more bucks will get you the MXR Badass distortion which has a much crisper tone to it. First some background: I've been playing bass for 2 years have used Line 6, Eden, Peavey, Orange, Marshall and Kustom amps and Ibanez, Peavey, JB Player, Fender, Yamaha, and Squire bass'.  This bass was a serious disappointment.  I've got a lot of love for Gibson and (due to $$$) Epiphone.  When I saw the Epiphone EB series in my local guitar shop I fell in love.  How can you not appreciate that SG body, and I've always preferred humbuckers to P or J pickups.  I thought I had found my hearts desire when I picked this up and began to play (classic rock & blues covers for reference) and then my heart broke.  The sound was lousy.  Of course I tried a different EB bass and different amps but the situation never improved.  Despite my sincerest wishes I can't recommend this excellent looking bass to anyone (unless they're looking for wall art or are willing to switch out the pickups).  You can pay the same price and get much better tone (I would recommend a Squire Jaguar if you really want a humbucker or if you want more tone versatility a Yamaha RBX 170). This is a cheap piece of junk that does what it says, it distorts, You want something to make your guitar sound like junk, this will do it. Why pedals that make your guitar sound like a piece of junk are the most popular is beyond me. This is not a boutique Distortion pedal like Hendrix would use. Boutique and distortion are an oxymoron.\n",
      "  These things are built with heavy metal, it should last, I kinda hope it doesn't(just kidding), you want distortion, you got distortion I just don't get why so many people use this capo. In my experience, it is useless.\n",
      "\n",
      "The spring is so tight, that it's going to pull some of your strings (probably the E,B and G) out of tune, every time you barre a fret with it. If you enjoy re-tuning continually, then you will probably like this capo.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I suggest you spend a little more and get the Planet Waves Tri-Action Capo. It will save you time and grief.\n",
      "The Tri-Action Capo keeps every string in tune, while giving a great tone, unlike the sharp, harsh tone that the Kyser produces.\n",
      "And yes, you can park it on the head when not in use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forget this capo, and invest in the Planet Waves Tri-Action cap. I bought one of these in July of 2013.  I had a black one that I have owned for over 10 years and works great.  This one, the spring doesn't keep the string down snug enough to prevent buzzing.  A complete waste of money.  I am going to buy one of these in the future...http://smile.amazon.com/G7th-Performance-Capo-String-Silver/dp/B0007GGUGA/ref=sr_1_1?s=musical-instruments&ie=UTF8&qid=1447375034&sr=1-1&keywords=g7%20capo%20for%20acoustic%20guitar\n",
      "My friend who is a professional highly recommends the one above. The 1.0 mm Dunlop Ultex feel MUCH thinner than 1.0.  Very flimsy and small.  No grip.  Stay with your old Dunlops, these Ultex Dunlops are terrible.  Dreadful. I got this for my Boss Loop Station, but it doesn't work very well.  I keep hoping I'll find something it DOES work well with... I have to take back my favorable review from before. After playing this for awhile I noticed that the sound breaks often on the higher register, and the headpiece seems to clog up very easily. I think the headpiece slot is too narrow and cramped on one side and there is some wood sharding inside the headpiece, which came this way new. I have now read similar complaints form other posters (which I should have read before -- I think all the glowing reports are either from shills or total beginner recorder players who mistake the fine finish for fine musical craftsmanship). What didn't this company turn out a precision instrument to begin with? And is it made in China or Germany -- it sure plays like it was made in China. Needless to say, I am very disappointed to spend thirty dollars on what doesn't even work properly and I will seek a refund. (By the way, I have played the recorder for fifty years and have a dozen plastic and wooden ones -- this is the only one clearly defective.) My case came with one broken latch. The shipping box was fine and the case was packed ok. It must have happened when it was manufactured. I fixed it with JB weld but I shouldn't have had to do this with a new $100 case. really bad.\n",
      "I am terribly irritated by this.\n",
      "As a rule I use Aquila and love the sound and how they hold the tuning is well.\n",
      "These strings are barely able to stay strung and keep coming loose.\n",
      "End result is that I bought a new set of strings.  You guessed it they are Aquila.\n",
      "Maybe it is just a case of a set of seconds' but whatever the reason I will not use them again.  I pitched these because of the name brand' ask have several classic Martins and thought the sane workmanship would be in these I was wrong.\n",
      "My 1st string won't even stay on my uke.\n",
      "All my other units which inck\n",
      "led my beloved concert and the sawtoothPinapple sound rich mellow and really hold their tunning.\n",
      "Good luck maybe you'll b more fortunate. This thing was not good at all. I returned it. Luckily this is only used to store a particular guitar in my house but this bag is barely more than a cheap dust cover. Very little padding. I wouldn't trust to take it out with a band and risk it getting tossed around too harshly. For the money it works but not really impressed. I expected a bit more from Epiphone. NOT GOOD FOR HEAVY LIGHTS This pickup didn't work out too well. Even though I adjusted it to almost touch the strings it still fail to pick up the vibration of the G, B and small E strings. It has a curve to it that puts the ends farther away from the strings than the middle section and there's no way to adjust it enough to get it close to those smaller stings. I've never played a guitar with a curve to the strings that would fit this pickup. It's a very odd and unworkable design. In addition, I couldn't deal with the slight delay that a guitar synthesizer causes when processing the signal. Having the sound come out a split second after I pick the string messes up my timing terribly. Some musicians can deal with it just fine, but I'm not one of those guys. I thought buying it directly to Fishman would guarantee a good deal. But it didn't.\n",
      "First of all, it didn't come in a box. It came wrapped in a paper.\n",
      "So, when I was going to install it on my banjo, a surprise: it's missing the blue steel shim. And I don't live in the USA, so I'll have to figure out a way to get a new one or improvise.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a shame. but unfortunately that is it's best quality. This is outdated technology, and I so wish I could sell mine. Who would I sell it to? I would have to tell them that it does not work very well.\n",
      "I have never encountered the clip problem, but for a buck and a half this SHOULD be better. Equalizers fail to remove the sound of your fingers plucking the strings. The finger sound IS the prevalent sound. Save your money for something better. It arrived and in the process of installing the pickup found that there were missing parts namely the screw driver and short guitar cable. Then when I got it done and ready to test I found that the guitar switch didn't work therefore the combination guitar/synth didn't work either. One installed I'm not going to uninstall and return. I found a way around the all issues so there you have it. Just buy a new one. These sticks are nothing like Promark before they were purchased by D'Addario. They don't look as cool, there's no sumo wrestler. Also, the paint rubs off very easy. The wood doesn't seem to be as good of quality as the originals either. Overall, very disappointed. For the price I thought it would out perform a graphic EQ. Was disappointed because my EQ was less in price and does much more than this unit.\n",
      "I do not recommend this product Not even close to fitting my guitar. sorry : ( maybe my ukelele? not recommended. Said they would replace this, not recieved in over a month. The 1.0 mm Dunlop Ultex feel MUCH thinner than 1.0.  Very flimsy and small.  No grip.  Stay with your old Dunlops, these Ultex Dunlops are terrible.  Dreadful. On my Ibanez acoustic, it only properly frets 5 of the 6 strings. Depending how I set it, either the low E or the high e would buzz obnoxiously.  I returned it for a Dunlop, which works beautifully. WHAT ON EARTH DO THEY MEAN BY PERFECTLY PLAYABLE?\n",
      "  I'm sorry for yelling,  but I actually paid \"good money\" for these,  because they showed up as an \"add on\" item,  and at the time there were four starts next to them.\n",
      "I should have gone to the trouble of reading all of the reviews,  but sadly,  I \"added them on\" based on the cursory glance.\n",
      "I hope my one star review will help someone else avoid making this mistake.\n",
      "And shame on them,  for saying these are perfectly playable.\n",
      "I bought FOUR and not ONE of them makes more than a horrible one-note high-pitched off-tune SCREEKING.\n",
      "These should be sold as beads,  or charms,  that look like \"real harmonicas\"\n",
      "NOT as playable instruments. Garbage.\n",
      "I bought 4 as gifts. Tested one. So bad I tested all four.\n",
      "Into the garbage they went. At $2 apiece I wasn't expecting much, but I wouldn't give one of these to anyone for any reason.\n",

      "Soooo much better than any other mini-harp out there.\n",

      "Be happier. Intended to maximize sales appeal to a wide range of musicians, the SR16 offers 50 different drum beat styles (rock, jazz, country, etc.) using up to 12 pieces of percussion instruments (kick, snare, cymbals, toms, etc.) making up a drum set. Each piece is assigned to a physical drum pad button on the face of the SR16. For me, I found only about a dozen factory-installed drum beat styles (called presets) I can use. Of these, I can easily change the tempo for live performances. BUT this is where easy ends.\n",
      "When I wanted to make changes to one of the presets, the instructions were of minimal help. Although it attempts to explain how to do a task, the instructions are generic, fragmented, and wordy. From the time I opened the box until I finally figured out how to make simple changes, I have spent three weeks in trial and error and handwrote a dozen pages of my own notes, tables, and instructions, just so I can use the SR16 adequately. I have not even attempted to create anything new and cannot imagine the nightmare it would be. This has been a frustrating experience, to say it respectfully. The reasons I plowed through all this frustration were 1) customer ratings and comments, 2) the lack of a reasonably priced competitive drum machines, and 3) the sounds were actually good enough for my limited use (Im a guitarist).\n",
      "Other shortcomings:\n",
      "1)  there are no options for drum intros and extros\n",
      "2) you cannot throw in a drum fills randomly which is very restrictive during a live, spontaneous performance when you cannot keep track of which beat you're on (the SR16 accepts two foot pedals)\n",
      "3) the display is not backlit and is difficult to read under low light conditions as youd expect in a performance\n",
      "4) some buttons are dual function but unlabeled, some buttons are toggle, some are momentary, some are single function; you just have to memorize which does what\n",
      "5) no trouble shooting guide\n",
      "6) a step-reference users chart inconveniently affixed underneath the SR16 instead of printed in the Reference Guide or as a separate card\n",
      "Im giving the SR16 a rating of one star because, although a great sounding drum machine, it is useless if you cannot use it. The instructions barely bridge the gap between a great machine and a great useable machine. Unless you have plenty of undisturbed time, lots of patience, and undeterred to writing copious notes, I would not recommend this $150 machine for you. Nothing at all like the original I owned in the mid 80s. Its more complicated and doesnt have as many options. I found a older version on ebay. But I chose to but new for the same price. Now the ebay unit has been sold. Terrible synthetic sounding drums. Very weak on jazz and blues rhythms, not particularly intuitive either. I never use it. working now very unintuitive module, very bad pad response which are also very small so not easy to use.\n",
      "The sounds are so, so. The only plus of this unit is the price, but anyway not very usable. I sold it within a month with 50% loss\n",
      "and got Boss DR-880. That what I should do in first place.. This cable caused my amp to pickup am radio stations. I swapped it out with my VOX cable and the problem went away. Connected it back up and the am radio station came back. I do not recommend this cable and replaced it with a Planet Waves American Stage cable which is awesome and has top quality shielding. Long story short, this string set has a strong metallic character, which distorts the natural sound of your guitar so much. Many people might like it, but for me, absolutely Noooooooo!\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a seagull guitar, so by its nature it sounds mellow, warm and mild with stock strings. So when my strings wear out, I got this. Now I feel like playing an EMG bridge on my fender/archtop's neck position, WITHOUT the power that an EMG pickup has to offer. Yes, it is that bad, you can't do this to guitars like Seagulls...\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line, I recommend this string set for people looking to boost distortion on their guitar. If you have guitars like seagulls or so, definitely avoid this string. I purchased these awhile ago, just put them on, the 4th and 6 BOTH broke! I have restrung my guitar many times. NEVER had this happen.\n",
      "Will not be buying them again. I received this guitar for my birthday and I was very excited play it as I had wanted a new acoustic bass for many years.  As I started to play, it became apparent very quickly that this guitar was a cheap piece of junk. I have played many Dean guitars over the years and I have always thought that Dean made a quality product. The action on this instrument is terrible. The last several frets were actually touching the stings. Also, the end of the frets were extremely sharp and made it almost impossible to play. Dean obviously has no quality control with this product. Buyer beware!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "I am very disappointed with this guitar and I will be returning it immediately. I have no plans to purchases a Dean guitar again. I've got a #3 and it felt like a Rico #4. Very hard reed. I could not use one. A waste of money. G string broke on first tune up didn't even get up to E. Stopped working after a month. Don't buy this item. Poor quality. The capo is to tight and causes strings to sound sharp.  The metal spring broke after three months.  Do not buy. This capo is not acceptable for acoustic guitars with low tension, as the clamping force is so tight that it bends the strings up. I would recommend getting an easily adjustable capo instead for much more versatility for the same price. I have seen the videos about adjusting this capo, and I am a 200 pound male who lifts weights daily and it hurt my hand and took a very long time to pull the capo looser. Even then, the tension was not equal across all strings. I would much rather turn a knob than gorilla force this into a suitable position. Beware the tension.  It's extreme and can mar the back of the neck or even fingerboard.  Finctionally it can also throw off the tuning because of the tightness.  It's also huge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Go with an manually adjustable unit which is what pros universally recommend--a Shubb or Planet Waves NS. This does work, but its not a real Keyser capo. When it arrived i compared it to my other keyser of the same shape.\n",
      "1. This label is Rights Reserved, like on the real one.\n",
      "2. There are no grooves or textured handle like on the real Keyser.\n",
      "\n",
      "I dislike when being charged for something of a brand u rely on. Only to discover its a fake. It dishonest and uses the reputation that took the Keyser Co. time to build. Just aint right. I'll buy mine at the guitar store now.\n",
      "Ive added a photo, the top is legit. Ordered the case and it came damaged so badly that it looked like it have been run over by a vehicle. the end of the case had a two inch opening when the case was in closed and locked position. Wow? The packaging is not adequate to protect the high performance travel case!?! Returned the case and ordered a second time.  The case once again came UPS and it was damaged again.  The case wass bent and did not properly seal when in the closed position.  Packaging was torn and looked like it was at the bottom pile of heavier boxes and or mis-handled.  I was then stupid enough to be talked into ordering a third time using Fed-Ex and guess what, the third case came damaged  again.  The packaging material is not adequate to protect this heavy duty travel case.  How could it survive being checked on a plane, as advertised? The aluminum track, at the point of closer, does not align side to side or up and down, when in the closed position.  I will look elsewhere for a top quality case to protect my expensive guitars. The capo I received has a shallow and short gripping ability.  It barely fit on my parlor guitar in depth and width and would not fit at all on my Ovation A/E guitar, neither of which has a very deep or wide neck.  Additionally, I found it to be difficult to grasp and open.  I threw it in the trash. Took FOREVER to arrive. Looked great. Then too difficult for my 13 year old son to use. I am a semi-pro musician.  I play a hybrid finger-style using a flat-pick and steel finger picks.  My primary guitar is a 1982 Taylor 555.  I found these strings to be utterly disappointing. Dull sounding with a very stiff and unresponsive feel.  For \"light\" gauge strings, they required an awful lot of torque to get them up to concert pitch.  So much so that it raised the action noticeably.  If my Taylor had been strung with these strings when I was shopping for a 12-String, I would have passed this outstanding guitar over. Impossibe to actually put on your guitar, since the holes in the leather were almost non-existent.. I ended up needing scissors, a screwdriver, and pliers. Beyond ridiculous, do not buy this strap or this brand. Material  very scrarchy and irritating.  You need to wear a thick shirt or sweater when wearing this. Not sure what happened. I've owned these before and found them reasonably functional, at least when considering convenience and cost. BUT this last one had a SOOOO MUCH spring tension that my 11 year old couldn't even use it. The compression on the strings was so extreme that it made the guitar (every guitar) play sharp. It's fine for pkaying solo, but you can't use it for a key change on one instrument and play with another properly tuned instrument (which is kind of the point). I'm also concerned about what it would do to frets after prolonged use. I pretty much limit it's purpose for repair and maintenance work when I need to make adjustments to something but don't want to restring the guitar.\n",

      "I recommend stearing clear from these entirely. Great picks.  They have a rough grip that makes them easy to keep hold of with sweaty hands.  I have played with them for over 30 years, and have never broke one.  They don't wear out.  The only reason I bought these was to replace ones that I have lost or given away. Too thin for any guitar.  Not sure what you could use them for, but on ultra light strings they are just like paper, totally useless. Blow You cannot adjust the beaters' angles!!! Do not buy this unless you are not a drummer and will never notice. I bought mine at Sam Ash but it's the same model. Save up a little more, especially if you are new to bass pedals. E string broke with little tension applied so really don't know how they sound. Ordered another brand. bend to easily make an odd sound Way to thin to be useful. All I can hear is the clacking of the picks against the strings. Sounds like when we used to put baseball cards in the spokes of our bikes when we were younger. Not what I expected, can't use them Not really Dunlop's fault, I bought the thicker (.73 mm) picks and love them.  These .46 mm picks are just way too thin, like paper thin.  I don't know how anybody can play with these. another item never received but i would not use anything over .88 mm anyway was mean for experimentation i have learned since this purchase. Dunlop .73 picks are the best picks in the world as far as I'm concerned. At a music store they range from 25 to 40 cents each. The description for this item does not show a quantity. Now that I received it, I find you get a dozen for less than four bucks, which wouldn't be bad, but then with the cost of shipping I ended up paying close to nine bucks for twelve picks. I did not see anywhere in the description of the item where they told how many picks you get, and I was hoping for more. This will only fit a standard wired microphone (SM-58 or others).  My wireless mics (which is what I bought it for) are too long, and the holes are too small.  I would take the foam out and modify it to my needs, but it is glued and sewn into the bag. I'm not sure what I'll do with the bag, but it won't be holding any microphones unfortunately. Looks cool.. but awkward it is upside down compared to the jim dunlop which I find much easier to use Hands down the worst bass drum patch I've ever owned. I have brand new tama speed cobras, and this patch's rough surface has eaten away the felt on the bass drum beaters. Now I'm out 30 bucks for new beaters. So this patch may be cheap, but don't let it's price fool you because it'll end up costing you in the end. get aquarian or remo instead. I've never had a problem with either like I did with the Evans patch. hated it, not better that the Remo Palam patches, don't buy this bc they will fall off over time, and its not as durable. A friend brought over this guitar for me to help him tune the guitar ( since I play guitar for over 20 years and own several guitars ), First thing I check is the neck to see if it is straight, and notice it is slight bend outward, After tuning the guitar 2 to 3 times ( because it slip out of tune quickly), I strum a few chords and it sounded terrible, all the chords I played (C,F,G,Am, D, D7, Dm E Em etc.) all have BUZZ sound, the strings do not have enough clearance to the FRETS, I think this could be the NUT and SADDLE are too high, You can never play a clear note with this condition, also extremely\n",
      "difficult for beginner to learn the basics. The product I received was a knock off brand and not an Ernie Ball strap. It even came in an \"cose\" package This no bueno The lubricant on the pad was dry on arrival and not usable. I compared what I received in this order with the same product available off the shelf at the local music store. The pad should have enough lubricant soaked in it that it is visible on your finger when touched or even pressed. Since the manufacturer's packing does not include any seal, just a tin lid as shown it dries out on the retailer's shelf or in the warehouse if not sold soon enough. Did not work well for us! Worthless ! I just don't get why so many people use this capo. In my experience, it is useless.\n",
      "\n",
      "The spring is so tight, that it's going to pull some of your strings (probably the E,B and G) out of tune, every time you barre a fret with it. If you enjoy re-tuning continually, then you will probably like this capo.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I suggest you spend a little more and get the Planet Waves Tri-Action Capo. It will save you time and grief.\n",
      "The Tri-Action Capo keeps every string in tune, while giving a great tone, unlike the sharp, harsh tone that the Kyser produces.\n",
      "And yes, you can park it on the head when not in use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forget this capo, and invest in the Planet Waves Tri-Action cap. I bought one of these in July of 2013.  I had a black one that I have owned for over 10 years and works great.  This one, the spring doesn't keep the string down snug enough to prevent buzzing.  A complete waste of money.  I am going to buy one of these in the future...http://smile.amazon.com/G7th-Performance-Capo-String-Silver/dp/B0007GGUGA/ref=sr_1_1?s=musical-instruments&ie=UTF8&qid=1447375034&sr=1-1&keywords=g7%20capo%20for%20acoustic%20guitar\n",
      "My friend who is a professional highly recommends the one above. I purchased this Dunlop model 224 Heavy wall brass slide, size medium, at the same time as ordering the Dunlop \"Moonshine\" model 243 slide also size medium...NEITHER of these Two slides are a Medium size. I have slides from many makers that fit my Pinky perfectly and they are size Medium. I now own TWO USELESS Dunlop slides...How two size \"mediums\" from the same maker can be different is totally RIDICULOUS and a lousy business practice. Buy Rock Slide for the best or Imperial Valley.... I'm Disgusted This is a wonderful product JUST BE CAREFUL  not to purchase from Brook Mays, my order never arrived and after waiting an extra 6 weeks hoping that my order arrived the said that a month had already passed. so I never got my product and they have nothing to do with that now. So great product but be aware who you purchase from. The product gets 5 stars but Brook Mays gets 0 out of 5 stars. Don't waste your money here; cheap feel Can't recommend these strings at all.  I used to play these and liked the sound enough, but they break quickly.  Never while playing but they'd unravel overnight over the fingerboard, and that's never happened with any other string.  The last straw was when I changed the strings, played literally one night, opened the case the next day and the D and A had both unraveled.  I play Pirastro Tonicas now, they have a darker tone that I like more, and they have never broken on me. I never come the product to my hands. I do not have information of the product, which I spend with the order? Learning the guitar is expensive and this is one lesson. The odor is bad. So bad I can not take it.\n",
      "Change the strings, Don't mess with this junk. Its not just the odor. I do not want anything this string close to my eyes. I was hunting for a solution to sweat and sticky. It helped the sticky thing some but created more problems that it helped. Cheap. No grip to them at all. Spend a little more for a better strap. This product is not what it seems. It has a cool name, but that's about it. It's a tool oil that stinks. I tried my best to get use to this product, but learned that there are much better ways after going into the studio and recording for the 1st time. After doing away with the Fast-Fret, my playing has improved and I hardly ever have to change my string because of gook. Not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty. I now use Old English and my guitars thank me, my nose thanks me and my fingers thank me. You will too... TOO SMALL, LIKE STUFFING A TURKEY. worst experience ever!!!!! When I put a reed on the mouthpiece that came with this set, you cannot put the cap over the mouthpiece.  won't at that point go on the ligature.  I need some help.  This just isn't right.  I've played alto sax for years and I don't understand this. Cannot use with more than three AC adapters (e.g. 9 volt \"wall warts\" for effects pedals). Poor design. They should have either spaced the outlets more or oriented the rows of three in opposing directions). I heartily recommend *against* purchasing these strings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately after putting these on my guitar, I was _unimpressed_.  The tension seems less than others (for example:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Elixir-Light-Nanoweb-80-20-Bronze-Acoustic-Guitar-Strings/dp/B0002E1O2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Elixir Light Nanoweb 80/20 Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/D-Addario-EJ16-3D-Phosphor-Bronze-Acoustic-Guitar-Strings-3-Sets-Light/dp/B000OR2RNM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">D'Addario EJ16-3D Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings, 3 Sets, Light</a>), and they rattled as if to agree with what my left hand felt in the tension.  To both hands, the strings felt slightly tacky.  Played fingerstyle, they sound dull, or muted, especially on the low end.  When played with a slide, they sound noisy, as if my left hand muting isn't working all of a sudden.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was just the first day!  I hoped they would improve, but they did not.  They continued to sound dull, especially played fingerstyle, as if they were really old.  In fact, that's it, in a nutshell: these strings feel and sound as if they'd been strung on a guitar gathering dust and oxidizing for a year; yet they were brand new.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the high E broke, (other reviewers have mentioned strings breaking too).  In the spirit of complete disclosure, I switch tunings a lot (DADGAD, open D & G, standard) and of course this will shorten the life of strings.  But still: these lasted less than 2 weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's fun to experiment, but these strings were so disappointing that I'm glad a string broke, to entice me to rid the guitar of them sooner!  For now it's back to D'Addarios; they are excellent sounding and value. Worst Amazon experience ever.  The product itself -- a portable battery operated amp which is indeed legendary and which I have owned and loved in the past -- is now apparently being manufactured by a cut rate outfit -- lots of cheap plastic parts, badly assembled that tend to fall apart.  It took three tries before I got one that held up after one use.  Just as cheap was the customer service from Amazon.  The return procedure from this item was not set up properly and it seemed impossible for customer service to manually override, so that I could return the defective merchandise.  Resolving the issue took six contacts. Eventually I was promised small credits and upgraded shipping for my troubles, but none of that came to pass either.  If you must buy this product (it's kind of a unique item) I strongly recommend you get it at Sam Ash or Guitar Center and test drive it to make sure your not getting a lemon. I've had one of these stick holders for 20 years.  Part of the clip finally broke off, so I ordered a new one.  The old one still works fine, and I plan to put the new one in the \"main\" position under the hi-hat, and the old one attached to a cymbal stand on my right side.  Now I can have an extra pair of sticks on both sides and never worry about fumbling after a dropped stick again!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Update:\n",
      "I initially gave this a 5-star review based upon the fact that the old one I had stood up to 20 years of use before it broke. I got the replacement months ago and after using it for a while I had to drop the review down to a 1-star review based upon the fact that the clamp is nowhere near as strong on this one as it was on the earlier version. Just brushing against the sticks in the holder can cause the whole thing to pop off of the stand and go flying.  I will definitely have to order a different stick holder and use this one as a backup or even just toss it.  It isn't worth the price. It is literally just a very small sponge (like the ones you buy at the grocery store for less than a dollar each) in a plastic holder. I feel like $8 is WAY too much to charge for something that costs pennies. Plus, worst of all, IT DIDNT WORK!! I kept a humidity meter in my guitar case and measured for a week making sure the sponge was always wet and the humidity in the guitar never changed. At least not on the meter. I have a previous version of this humidifier from Planet Waves, and I'm confused.  Compared to the competition, even the \"old\" design was only marginally effective; the sponge inside that holds the moisture was barely big enough to do the job.  Now, rather than slightly raise the price (which I'd rather pay for a unit that's gonna work), they SHRINK the size of the absorbent media.  In the case of candy bars, all you get is less for your money.  In the case of a guitar humidifier, you get a product that WILL NOT protect your investment (aka: your guitar).\n",
      "\n",
      "I recommend NOT wasting time on this unit.  There are other units that your guitar would celebrate as a veritable \"oasis\" of moisture. the lit rocker switch is poorly position, VERY easy to hit and thereby shutting off all power when plugging in near the switch. The switch is also easy to trip; almost no finger pressure needed to turn off the unit. Furman makes pro level stuff and IMO items like this one tends to cheapen the Furman reputation Dont bother! This part does does not fit my 2008 Gibson Robot Les Paul Studio Silverburst Ltd Ed. Piece of crap. That is all. Did not fit my Epiphone Les Paul. not even close. bought one, then found out how small the sponge is. IMO it's not worth buying unless you need minimal addition of humidity Doesn't fit my son's guitar. Not worth the hassle of returning or exchanging. Doesn't fit my son's guitar. Was bought as a gift. Don't buy in advance! By the time he got it and figured out that it doesn't fit his guitar, the seller refused to even do an exchange for another product! Um, no. It certainly looks authentic, however does not fit a Gibson 2003 plus top les paul, Dean standard or epiphone fx pro plus top. It does however fit my Chibson Ace freshly les paul perfect (Chinese reproduction) Sounds like this May not be an authentic Gibson product. Not a true pass-through. So noisy when turned off its not usable in my chain. I special orderd a Boss BF-3 Flanger from Guitar Center. I kept it 2 weeks & took it back. This pedal sucked: EXTREMELY metallic sounding & the Flanging was not pronounced enough. I was shocked because in the 1980's I used a Boss BF-2 Flanger that was pretty darn good. I then tried a Hartman Flanger. Great effect, just a HUGE volume bump when tuned on. I dumped The Hartman & went for the \"absolute kabala\" of Flangers. I went out & bought a REAL Flanger: The ADA Flanger. Strings are 2\" too short. Was dried out and crumbled. Case cracks easily broke in the center after an hour of normal use on an electronic kit.  Super lame.  I also got a terrible blister because of the rubber, I am a seasoned drummer and my hands are strong but the rubber just rubs me the wrong way.......... Junky, budget-line low grade with a nice logo.\n",
      "i decided to return within 10 seconds of looking this over.\n",

      "SHAME ON GATOR\n",
      "believe me i was just as disappointed to unpack a piece of garbage from a name like GATOR as you would be. but gotta say they have a reputation to uphold and deserve NO slack for selling CRAP....dont buy it unless you plan on using it for storage in your closet. in the real world this won't last 6 months without falling apart.\n",
      "made in China, naturally. Personally I don't hear any difference in sound in any way at all .Looks to me that you could buy some foam without a company logo on it and get the same result for less money. Good Pedal, but extremely big and heavy. If you don`t have a lot of extra space on your pedal board or you don`t want carry too much weight, then buy the JR, the small one. This pedal is big big big. I'm sure these would be great strings for my little cello but I haven't been able to install them. The leader on the C & G string is wound so thick I can't even thread it through the pegs on my full size cello let alone the thinner holes on the smaller pegs on the small cello. VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED, at this point. Waiting to hear from Amazon This mic made me look bad several times while djing. Lots of noise and no on and off switch. Don't use this in aloud environment. The feedback is horrible. Do not buy!  I bought these twice and had them replaced twice.  Never again.  The Evans Dot drum head is much better. Rad sounding pedal but poor internal quality. It went bad after one year on my pedal board. It was protected with \"pedal power\" but just stopped working. I sent it off for repair and all they said was, \"It cannot be repaired, we will return your pedal back to you next week.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I sincerely expected a $170 pedal to last longer than one year. Not what I expected. Not very effective. It just randomly pops off my bass, it's so slick that when you let go it the neck just goes straight down. I hate it. This strap is what you pay for. It is cheaply made and will not last the rigors of stage.\n",
      "Strap is not for pro use.\n",
      "Would not recommend for stage use unless you want a busted guitar neck. This amp sounds absolutely terrible with a bass. I've tried it with multiple different basses and multiple different cables and nothing seems to make a difference. I don't know why there are so many good reviews for this amp as the speaker and casing rattle so much you can barely hear the tone. Even at low volumes the farty buzz is overwhelming and extremely unpleasant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vinyl wrap is so cheaply applied that right out of the box it is starting to come off and touching the speaker. I thought maybe they shipped me a defective unit but the replacement I got is just as bad. If you're looking for something portable to play bass with, avoid this at all costs. I tried this on a live gig from a buddy who raved about this pedal. Its has a great distortion and sustain, but its got a compressor circuit and you cant adjust it or turn it off, when I tried to pound a high note the attack and volume gets squashed/neutered. I know funk bassists and studio cats dig a good compressor but I absolutely cant stand one on my live rig(I expect and count on a GOOD soundman to add it in a live mix, great, as long as I cant hear it). Kinda pricey too, I ended giving this pedal back to my buddy, no thanks. I ended up buying the comparable MXR dist/D.I. that has a mid control and noise gate @ about a third less than what this pedal costs. IMHO a much better deal; more for less and no compress(ion). Says the numbers are white and embossed. They are not Been waiting a week to get this. Was excited when the UPS guy handed me my bubble wrap envelope. Was sickened when I  opened the package, however. Even if I could boil it clean it's unsightly! Major abrasions down the front, chips out of the paint, scratches, and what I'm guessing is oily fingerprints. I really don't know what it is...and just dirty. They couldn't even wipe it down! Who on earth thought this was acceptable to sell?! Not like they warned it was used, I would have never bought it. Rant over. It's going back. So disappointed. Washer was misprinted, shouldn't have made it past quality control\n",
      "Edit: Received a replacement with similar printing issues. Will not be buying this product in the future fell in less than 1 foot broke into 10 pieces The strap slides all over the place. It's very pretty, but what good is it if it slides? How do you fix the sliding? Feels like a 5 dollar beginner strap.  Very cheap, stiff, scratchy plastic material backing.  The folds and creases do NOT go away and look ridiculous when hanging on your guitar.  Strap ends are however a very thick leather, and are absurdly hard to fit over a strap button.  At $20, this strap is a total ripoff.  I would not buy this strap for $5.\n",

      "Luckily, Amazon is awesome and I was able to return it hassle free. Awful quality it's squeaks Very small, can't even get my finger in this damn thing I have compared this Yamaha recorder to an Adler wooden soprano recorder.  There are many differences between the two instruments.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all the Adler recorder has a richer softer more mellow tone compared to the louder more piercing tone of this instrument.  The two instruments are also made in separate countries.  The Adler is made in Germany, whereas the Yamaha is made in China.  The two instruments are also encased differently.  The Adler comes in a blue and white Velcro case.  The Yamaha comes in a cheap plastic case with a hard to close snap.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both of these instruments have Baroque fingering.  For the most part, they both play each note in tune, except for one. The F note on the Yamaha recorder is actually F sharp.  Not so on the Adler.  If you have a recorder student in your household who is learning to play the instrument for the first time, this recorder is fine for that.  As he or she grows up and advances in music, consider buying an Adler soprano recorder.  Recorder teachers should also be aware of the differences between these two instruments. My 14 year old son loves Mike Portnoy, but these were the 2nd pair of drum sticks within a month.  They don't last.  Yes, he loves drumming every day, but they should last longer than not quite a month.  We just bought 2 more pair from another company. I'm hoping these last longer.  I would not recommend these sticks. We would love to suggest using a hemp plastic is toxic and we have cut enough trees down on this planet! If you are looking for a recorder that can play in tune, do not consider buying this.  My kids have these for their elementary school music classes.  These cannot play notes with proper pitch.  We tried to tweak by adjusting the 3 pieces but cannot get any of them to play with proper tuning.  For example, D is registered between D and E flat.  Same problem with all other notes.  If you are serious about music, this probably is not for you. This seemed so cool when I first got it..  This piece of crap lasted two gigs!  the bottom of the small cymbal compartment separated first.  Last night at my second gig with it?  The zipper tongue fell off!  wow.  Never had a product fail this fast in my life.  Really disappointed. All within 9 days. On a good note, the vendor, music 123 took it back and credited me in a timely manner. Very good store and recently made another from them through amazon. It worked about 10 minutes and started cutting out. Sent it back. Introduces far too much hiss into the signal chain to be useful. The eq seems to function correctly but you won't get past the hiss unless you have a noisy rig to begin with. Noisy pedals make bad rigs worse and good rigs bad. shipped to me broken :P I was looking for an EQ for my guitar and read a lot on the subject prior to purchasing the Danelectro model. I made a bad choice. It was cheaply made and I didn't get the satisfying \"click\" from it when I tried to turn it on as I did from my other foot switches.  Then, after only two weeks of light usage, it just quit working.  During the same time period, I also tried out a Boss EQ stomp box which was highly superior to the Danelectro in both quality of sound and construction.  I would not recommend the Danelectro product. It's heavy (12+ lbs), it's ugly (just look at it) and the overdrive is useless. Nice \"portable\" design with two heavy UPS batteries in the back, plus the massive power supply. This amp just makes no sense to me.\n",

      " I can't imagine what the five-star reviewers were thinking. I've owned probably a dozen different little practice amps and this is hands down the worst. Broke after two months, bad heating element. super small and the remote on has a manual feature We followed the instructions exactly. It put out less smoke than a candle. You couldn't even see the smoke. It was so pitiful. On the side, it says that you can only use that brand of fog fluid. Scam. DO NOT BUY!!!! A huge scam. Luckily, Amazon let me return... I bought one and returned it. I bought it for a school dance for my daughter. It sent it back and never got to use it. It smelt like it was on fire and melting plastic or something. Literally smoking. I did get another one, this one was the same exact thing. When it does turn on it works great, but only lasts for about 30 seconds before it turns off and then takes about a minute to reheat, then you can push the button manually to turn it back on. You have to sit next to it all while you want to use it as it doesn't turn on automatically. And it smells terrible. I never used it at the school as it would turn on the fire alarms. The kids were so disappointed. I never write bad reviews but this one was a terrible product in my opinion. ok I bought mine new in 2014. It hardly saw any use except for the initial audio tryout. Today August  10, 2017 it has failed. All patterns except for figure 8 are cutting out and there is excessive noise. I checked inside the mic and it has a sealed pot that can NOT be cleaned. These are similar to the pots in the Chinese made Marshall effects pedal that have been failing. I would stay clear of CAD products as I have also had Trions fail. One was defective brand new from the factory. Button does not work- the thing just goes all the time. Please take this review as an exception. I believe this is not representative of this product, which was returned to seller.  The mic I received had several problems 1) Loud 5 second burst of pink noise when +48v applied; 2) takes about 20 seconds for mic to come up to full sensitivity; 3) noise floor on the mic I received was approximately 17 dba (almost 25 times greater than spec); 4) low end response, without the roll-off filter switched in, was about 6 db lower than spec at 50 Hz; 5) Senstivity was also low @1khz; 5) mic was quite noisey during first the 10 minutes, but the noise floor and the intermittent sporadic low-level crackling sounds gradually decreased after 30 minutes of having power applied, but the intermittent low-level crackling noise never completely disappeared.\n",

      "THEY ARE WAY UNDER VALUE FOR A SHOW I got the tripod fast but,  the packaging was horrible! Some parts are broken and can't use the tripod. I think it would have worked fine but the packaging was crap. I still haven't gotten in touch with anyone about it. I want it replaced! Basically the part that's broken is where I can't extend it up to the 12 feet. So it won't go up cause the knob is broken off and I can't extend! Bummer! I own a 14 of these clamps and the ones produced by \"Leestar\" are the real deal. If the clamp doesn't have the \"Leestar\" raised stamp with the nut symbol on the flat side where the T-fastener tightens your clamp will not tighten enough on your 1.5 truss. Your fixture will sag instantly. The new 1.5 clamps sold by Amazon no longer have this stamp and now they sag. I recently ordered four more and now have to return them as they are crap. Did American DJ go with a different manufacturer to cheap out? Not sure, but, these are worthless now and I'm not lining them with black duck tape to fix this issue. I'm going to call American DJ to see what's up with this. These strings rust so easily in Hawaii's weather. Honestly I've never seen a set of strings rust over night until I strung my American Special Steaf... do not buy if you live in a humid area!!!!! These are the weakest strings ever. I replaced the nut and bridge on my old Washburn and the high E string broke three times. I FINALLY had to substitute the fist E string with one of the second strings from another packet, which my calipers show to be the same diameter.\n",

      "Also, if you play your guitar for 5 minutes afterward you will have a bunch of nickel-phosphorouse gray stains on your fingers.\n",
      "Terrible quality. JUST PLAIN TERRIBLE. E (1) string broke before I could even get it half way tightened up to be in tune. No more Fender strings for me. I didn't buy these at Amazon, but at a local national guitar shop. Broke a G string after a couple days. Merely tuning it and it broke. Won't buy again. Not a fan of these strings. I have tried and tried in the past to like Ernie Balls, but they have done nothing but disappoint. I'll just stick to the more expensive Elixirs. Admittedly, I bought these because of the low price, but paid for it in time spent re-stringing.  \"Unpleasantly twangy...\" and rusted the E and B strings in about a week.  I hadn't played on them more than 5 times for a couple hours at a time.  I keep my acoustic in a nice Taylor gig bag in a relatively dry, room-temp climate, so not sure how this happened so quickly.  Wound-up replacing them the next weekend.  I switched to Elixirs - my usual strings of choice. This pedal absolutely kills the tone of the instrument. If you don't have the threshold turned to max it won't kill the hum but if it's turned to max it kills the tone. I returned it and got the ehx hum debugger instead and it doesn't kill the tone. This pedal was a huge let down. I expect more from rocktron because most of their stuff is of quality build but it's like they quit halfway through with this pedal. I recommend the EHX or the ISP if you want to kill the hum. I don't like Ernie Ball strings. Period. Just my humble opinion. I tried the Elixir and after only a week I though they were not doing well so I tried these. The ratings on here are good. I even got two packages since the price was right. Well, I like the Elixir's better. These were one third the cost.  Learning about strings is expensive. These are the same as light - medium. I was running medium on the Elixir's but that was too much. The size on these are better but I like the sound of the Elixir's more. The feel of these strings are ok though.. I do not like the overall sound of the strings but on some songs they are not too bad. Without the coating of the Elixirs, they are better as strings. They are not strong enough on a lot of sounds though. I truly believe that they are counterfeit. Every .012 string or the 1st String that I tried to tighten broke on me with least resistance.  Mess with me once.......Shame on you !  Never Again ! Great strings. Shipping made them 2bucks more than local price. Tried these, but the low A broke within 45 minutes of practice playing on my 12 string acoustic just after re-string. It snapped over the saddle, something that I've never had for a low wirewound string. I've had the high G break near end of life, but never had a string go out when brand new. Compared to D'Addario Extra Lights I normally use, they are heavier gauge, the sound is bright and quite metallic, maybe a bit more body to the sound than the D'Addario's, and not bad in my opinion. But they are coming straight back off. Can't afford to risk a string going at the next gig. Back to the D'Addario strings for me. Despite what the other reviewer stated, I have serious doubts about the construction of this mute.  It's basically cardboard with a wood base. I don't know how DW can call this \"fiber\".  In 2013, when one talks about fiber, one is talking about woven materials that are strong, durable, man-made materials.  While this is clearly man-made, it's neither strong nor durable, in fact it came with a soft spot in it already, likely where someone pressed on it too hard with a finger or thumb.  Dennis Wick makes a far better mute, the DW5531, that doubles as both a cup and straight mute.  While it's more expensive, it's far better made and offers both standard mutes that every trumpet player should have.  If you can't afford the DW5531, but the old standard Harmon J1 Triple Play Combo Trumpet Mute. From electric  to these 120% let down everytime  idk maybe it's me but they always sound  dead  break halfway through sets .... Always go back to ghs burnished and blue steel acoustic last forever and bright in your face sound These strings sounded terrible. I am frugal and try to make anything work, but I had to take them off and throw them away almost immediately. You just can't get the right sound with these. The problem may be that the G string isn't wound - at any rate, it's not wound (as it should be), and it doesn't sound right. Fretting an F chord just sounds dissonant, and no song sounded right. Do yourself a favor and stay FAR away from these strings. I'm a long time musician, and a long time user of Ernie Ball Strings (on electric guitars). Unfortunately, I can't endorse these strings, even though they sound great and the light gauge saves my fingers. The problem is that they break, in my humble opinion, excessively easily. I put a set on and broke a g string within 2 days of moderate use. It snapped near the saddle, so I didn't think much of it. I replaced the set, and within a few more days I noticed that the wrapping on the g string was broken and becoming unraveled near my third fret. I bought 7 sets, so I still have 5 more sets to go through, but honestly I'll probably go back to elixirs when these are gone, since they seem to last longer.\n",

      "I purchased these strings on 12/19. It' now 1/18, and I've broken 3 strings from 3 different packs.\n",
      "At this point, I really hate these strings. My first time straying from Elixirs for a long time.  I got these in a pinch and figured they would be alright for a short while.  Put them on and almost tuned up.  The 3rd string core wire snapped while tuning up. Almost made it to G.  Yes, standard G w/ tuner\".  Oh I was so PeeD! I was told they would be warm sounding and that is not true. Too bright and thin sounding. Go for Martins instead. I purchased these strings and put them on my Alvarez, Even after 3 weeks they were still constantly going out of tune. I couldn't even play three songs without having to retune. I'm going back to my Martin 80/20's. I do not see how this gets such good reviews. They sound tiny to me also. I do not like expensive strings either. I will not be trying these again for a long while. I will try some other brands. If you do get these, I advise not to get over one package at a time. I do not believe the good reviews. Ordinarily I try to buy only top name strings and don't bother with cheap ones, but I bought these strings on the advice of another player.  I had been using D'Addario EXPs, which have given me great service.\n",
      "\n",
      "So this change, I tried Earthwoods and had 2 out of 12 strings break while installing them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Earthwood skinny G string snapped before it even got close to a G. It is quite uncommon for me, with the strings I normally buy, to have a brand new string snap.  I've been playing for a couple of decades now, and was even using a headstock tuner, so over tightening was not an issue. I continued stringing....only to have one of the B strings snap as well... long before it was close to a B.\n",
      "Fortunately, I save my old strings aside -- just for this eventuality -- so I re-installed two of my old strings and was able to get playing.  (Note - the D'Addarios did not break!)\n",
      "The Earthwoods sound alright once installed (remember, I have two D'Addarios on there) however I doubt I will bother with these again. I don't like mixing old and new strings, and don't feel a need to put up with brand new strings breaking.  I'll play it this way until I can get to the store for another set of D'Addarios. you've seen the colorized strings out there, these are just painted black. they took a cheap set of roundwounds and dipped them in black paint, nothing smooth or warm about them. These are NOT tape wound, there is no tape on these. The G string lost its brightness within a week, I put them on two basses to see if it would make a difference but nope. Sorry Guys\n",
      "These strings were the worst tapewounds or not. From day one, gig one, my G string was not even half volume, D followed shortly after. I just finished taking them off and replacing them with what was on there to confirm it wasn't my bass. Acctually, they feel like spray painted strings if you wanta what know the truth, years ago I played tape wounds that well... were literally coming off in ribbons after awhile. Its ok live and learn. I use an XLR cable so the only good thing about this stand is that it holds the guitar high enough off of the ground to accommodate the jack.  Otherwise, NOT at ALL suitable for stage use.  My guitar cable and guitar strap wrap around the base or the back so it is a tangled mess whenever I pick it up.  I can't imagine even using it at home if you keep a strap attached.  It doesn't take much to knock it over.  In fact I was playing an outdoor gig at the Virginia Beach oceanfront.  A breeze kicked up and blew the guitar & stand  over taking a nice chunk out of the headstock -- good thing it wasn't my favorite guitar. Put scratches on the front of my 6 string dreadnaught guitar. Not a good but. I broke my machine head by forcing this behemoth of  a string in to it. Then once I cut and placed the string the darned thang unwound and would NOT grip. Destroyed string AND MY TUNING PEG!\n",

      "Heed all warnings on this product. I've been doin' this stuff for 45 years and ain't never seen nothin' like this bull before... Bad Fender... Bad! Shocking that Fender's stand was made so poorly it could scratch my Fender! Won't hold my ernie ball bass, nor any other instrument I own.... It is strictly designed for a tele or strat (so it seems). I couldn't even give this away. I asked two of my friends and they both said no thanks... ...for something, but not a guitar.  Wasn't sure what to do with it so I now use it to mount a large cookbook, or notepad computer, so I can follow a recipe.  It seems to work okay for that.  Just don't use this for guitars.  An electric guitar will slide out and fall because it leans back too far, and the arms have no grip.  This thing was obviously created by a monkey in some closed door creative testing experimental project.  It may even give you AIDS!  But probably not.  However, animals could have been harmed in the making.  But most likely, and in reality, it will not hold your guitar in a safe manner. Total flimsy junk. It leans WAYYY too far back. I'll be damned if I put my $1000 guitars on these things. On the other hand, ChromaCast makes one that's very close to this price, and I doubt that it could have been more for the money I paid.\n",

      "In summary... DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK. Very disappointed guitar came damaged with dents and scratches it deffenatley not new guitar. I tried it with an SM57 on snare and the knob that holds the arm loosened after about 7 songs so the mic was laying on my snare drum. I assume this is due to the higher frequency vibrations on that drum. On toms, it is suitable but it still doesn't offer much flexibility for mic placement. The arm is octangular shaped and I could never get my Beta56 microphones in a great location. I would rather use an LP Claw or not clamp to the drum than use this. Had a terrible time figuring out how to put this contraption on and haven't used it since purchasing.  Maybe I will spend some more time with it later in an effort to get the hang of it.  Might just be me, but I imagine that others will have problems with it too. Item too short, with no way to extend ; make sure you get the right fit when you order. measure twice order ONCE These stings do not keep tune well even after stretching and feel harsher than non coated strings. Coating also begins to peel off within the first couple days leaving frayed bits of plastic on the strings.... Bought this for my Deering banjo and guess what? It's not compatible with Deering. After half hour struggling i could install it but it is not comfortable at all. The strap is really heavy and not flexible. It relieves some of the pressure but still uncomfortable to carry around.\n",
      "\n",
      "I removed it directly and have ordered an original Deering strap. I bought these hoping it would last longer than 3 months without rusting. It didn't. I wipe the strings after playing and keep my guitar in a hard shell case and still I could feel rust on the strings after less than 2 months, so for me it's not worth the extra cost. I am older and I bought this harness to take the weight of the tenor sax off of my neck.  I am of fairly average size for an adult male, 5'10' tall, 160 lbs., and I can not adjust this harness to feel comfortable ---the side straps cut into my lats.  The harness is also difficult to adjust to have the mouthpiece come up to my mouth; instead I end up getting it sort of close to where I want the mouthpiece to be, and then bend my neck to bring my mouth down to the  mouthpiece (and this is not how you want to play the sax).\n",

      "The basic Neotech 1901162 for about $11 to $16 is better, but be careful selecting the size.  For tenor sax players you are likely to need the X-Long, which really isn't very long.  The \"regular\", is just a little too short for tenor ----Neotech could have easily added a few inches of material to the \"regular\" size and it would have worked for most people for both alto and tenor sax. Super short...I put this on with the strap fully extended and the bass was literally resting on my upper chest.\n",

The only saxophone I can use with this strap is my curve soprano, its to short, do not want to take time to exchange. I purchased these strings about a week ago and I put them on my acoustic guitar the minute they arrived. Now, I have noticed a buzzing from the G string! Previously I have purchased the Nanoweb strings from Elixir and those would last for up to 2 and a half months! I do not play with a heavy strum and the string is doing this already....? Definitely something wrong here. I would NOT buy this product again! Sure a more expensive brand cable might be better made, could last longer, and might have a better warranty, but as far as sending signal from your mics to your preamps, they sound just the same as their budget counterparts. EVERY musician feels their hearing is better than a dogs.

They were kind of spongy & bouncy, thus their claim of reducing the feel of the weight of the horn. Well this feels stiff, has very little cushioning, and will take quite a while to actually sit on my neck, as it is now so stiff, it just wants to remain straight.

I purchased a set of these already knowing that I don't like Ernie Ball sTeel strings, but now I don't like Ernie Ball nylon strings either. The g-string is the flattest, dullest sounding I've ever heard. In its defense, the 3 wound strings sounded marvelous, but 3 out of 6 isn't good by my standard. Don't waste your money with these unless you are stringing a guitar for someone you don't like.

Oh, and before you ask, nothing was set up differently on my LP Standard. The only difference was your botched strings.

I can't barely get one string unwound or wound on my bass without needing to stop and re-adjust the connecting screw on this. I'm not sure if this is a D'Addario manufacturing problem but I'm really displeased with the quality of this winder. Using a regular tuner work's better, not worth the money. It didn't take long for the screw that attaches the handle to come loose. I solved the problem by inserting a couple of washers between the screw and handle and handle and the cutter part. Why weren't washers installed in the first place?! String winder broke off, I'm gentle with my equiptment and have never had a string winder break.  That is until now. Waste of money... This is my experience: I used a brand new Pro torque drum key to put new drum heads on a new set of drums. That's why I bought the ProTorque.  However, it was absolutely no use in tuning the drums. The loosest setting on the dial of the drum key put too much tension on the lugs and tightened the head way above normal tuning range. The higher settings on the dial are so tight that there is no use for it. The pressure it is inconsistent and the device is just not sensitive enough to tune drums properly.

Well, disappointment!  They didn't stay in tune at all.  I found myself tuning between each song, and my conclusion is I wasted the money.  I went to a guitar store and they put on the Elixer  light strings.  The sound is 100% better!  I have played at least 10 songs so far and minor tuning at most.  I don't know what the extra lights are for, but certainly not my type of guitar!  The mediums were recommended in the user manual, but I found barring difficult.  Much easier with the Elixer lights. Junk i gave it away The rest works about as you'd expect, but the pin puller is a terrible design.  It only fits the pins on about half of my guitars, and provides Zero leverage.  I have no idea why they changed the design from having the peg puller be part of the winder, but it's a serious fail.  You'd be better off getting a $2 Dunlop 100SI winder/peg puller, and a small set of wire cutters.\n",

Very bad finish lots of defects and chrome is Pelling off. This thing is absolute garbage. They should update the picture, it doesn't look anything like that anymore either. Now, the clipper disappears into the handle. The bridge pin puller is too wide, and thin, so it's also weak and mostly useless. This is a very poorly designed product. I built a partscaster.

So, imagine you've got this mounted exactly half way between your E and B strings, but the depression where the strings rest is right up against the side of the guide on one side, and 3/16\" away from the side on the other side!  I at first thought this one was trash, too, until I noticed that the spindle is actually a separate piece pressed into a hole in the main body.  I was able to push that pin back to the center using my vice and a pair of vice-grips.  It wasn't easy, though, because I had to pad the whole thing with leather strips to keep from messing up the chrome plating.  I got it to work, but I'd never buy them again...or if I did, I'd by several pairs, hoping that I'd come up with a couple usable ones out of the bunch. Did not fit my audio technica headshells and cartridges.  I attempted with two different; a Shure and an AT cartridge. It would have damaged either if closed.  Also, the first picture is not what was sent to me.  I  Notice, that picture does not show the case with cartridges.  It was useless to me. squeaked horribly until I added a few drops of oil\n",

      "UPDATE: today it fell apart. This is garbage..I threw it away, and will buy a better one. Very disappointed. Worst strings I have ever used.  I put these on a high quality Taylor and the sound was all midrange.  No full sounds, no brightness, no projection.  I am returning to D\"Addarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "These strings sounds worse than completely dead strings. These are not elixir strings they aren't coated with anything!!! Does not trim the High E string.  That's the point of using these tuners, so that you don't have to trim the strings.  G string broke right away also. Bulls*** that you gotta spend 25 to get a 3 dollar item Just received these and one of the two appeared tarnished or dirty; Upon close inspection I can see that about 50% of the chrome colored coating is peeling away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Granted, these are not very expensive parts but if they are falling apart when still unused and in the package I can only imagine how they might look in a few years!\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't plan to even put these on my guitar; I bought these as part of the upgrading process; Not to make my instrument look shabby. First, let me explain where I'm coming from.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a 2006 Epiphone Les Paul that I liked, but it sounded a little muddy. I decided to switch out the pickups for Seymour Duncans - boom! Magic! I think switched out the wire - boom! More magic! Then, I decided I wanted a vibrato (aka tremolo) system on my guitar, so I got the Stetsbar bridge and was happy; it even held tune okay. However, I decided I wanted to get tuners that would REALLY hold it in tune, and I was intrigued by the Planet Waves Auto Trim locking tuners. Big mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that no hardware is going to be absolutely, 100% perfect, so bear in mind that I'm comparing these tuners to the stock Grover tuners my Epiphone came with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two main problems with the Planet Waves tuners:\n",
      "\n",
      "#1. Strings are breaking all the time! I never had this problem before, even when I installed the whammy system. I'm finding myself going through a different high E string every day - and I play in flat tuning, so it should be reduced string tension. The B string is also a common casualty.\n",
      "\n",
      "#2. These tuners can't hold tune. The problem is most noticeable on low E, but is also an issue everywhere else. If I start a song perfectly in tune after using a chromatic tuner, I find three minutes later that power chords sound awful because low E is flat. I've tried tightening the gears - I've even used a wrench - but there's nothing I can do to prevent slipping.\n",
      "\n",
      "I get the impression that these tuners were designed specifically for standard and heavy strings. I like light strings, though, and it looks like these tuners simply can't handles 8s and 9s the way they should.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, I know all tuners will eventually slip a little and you need to retune from time to time. With the stock Grover tuners that my Epiphone came with, though, I was only having to tune my guitar once or twice a week. After two months, I just gave up and replaced the Planet Waves tuners with the old Grover ones. Been doing guitar work for 45 years. Used to sell for a few different string manufacturers. I do NOT like these strings. Bought them for a customer's guitar, her request. Guess what? I still don't like them. I hate these strings. They are horrible sounding. Not at all what I expected from this head. It sounded hollow, empty of any tone. Im sticking to my remo powerstroke. Broke one almost instantly, then had to go to the store and buy more strings anyway.  not worth it at all in my opinion. At first, I thought it would be great to have extra light strings on my guitar.  I have a GS Mini Taylor.  Well, disappointment!  They didn't stay in tune at all.  I found myself tuning between each song, and my conclusion is I wasted the money.  I went to a guitar store and they put on the Elixer  light strings.  The sound is 100% better!  I have played at least 10 songs so far and minor tuning at most.  I don't know what the extra lights are for, but certainly not my type of guitar!  The mediums were recommended in the user manual, but I found barring difficult.  Much easier with the Elixer lights. Unfortunately doesn't fit Taylor guitar neck. I'm not a novice. My gigging guitar is a Taylor 816ce, which is the guitar I purchased this for and what I'm writing about. If you squeeze to open the capo all the way (as if you're in a hurry and just want to make sure it's open) and then push it all the way onto the neck until it bottoms out (again, to make sure it's seated quickly) it's possible / very likely that the EDGE of the padding (a surface of hard rubber about 1/16 inch x 1/2 inch) will catch on the neck binding (edge of the neck) and the capo won't close all the way. This leaves the two bass strings open and puts a lot of pressure on the very small edge of the pad on your binding. Not terrible if you have a plastic binding but the binding on my 816 is maple, which could be prone to damage under this kind of pressure. Not cool.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a fatal design flaw. When playing live I don't have 5 seconds between songs to finesse a capo or inspect it carefully to make sure it's seated properly. These are supposed to be \"squeeze and go.\" I have absolutely no idea where the positive reviews come from. A Taylor 816 is basically the quintessential acoustic guitar. How does a company design an acoustic capo that doesn't work well for a person who performs live with a Taylor?!?! Also buy some lube cause thing squeals like a pig and gets really hot fron the friction. These are not elixir strings they aren't coated with anything!!! This is a piece of squeaky junk, and worst of all it cut me badly when clipping a guitar string. Warning: When the handle comes together after cutting a string the little prongs sticking out of the inside of the handle will cut you. see them just on the left edge of the black handle (inside edge). The handle squeaks loudly when winding guitar strings. Do I have to keep this oiled. Its going in the trash can as a lesson learned. I wish Fender would enter the 21st century when it comes to pick thickness. The size and shape of this pick are exactly what I wanted and expected, but in spite of the fact that they are stamped \"Extra Heavy\", I wouldn't even be willing to describe them as \"Medium\". It's as if Fender scaled the thickness down from the 351 pick along with the other dimensions. The thinness of this \"Extra Heavy\" pick gives it such a brittle little sound that it's completely useless to me...except maybe to use as a template for grinding a 2mm Dunlop 500 down to the size I wish they were. Every pack we bought has broke within 1 day. The quality is poor not worth the money. not worth the money I don't know what the problem is with these strings.  I've been playing for 22 years and have always used Ernie Ball's.  This is the first time I'm trying 'coated' strings due to a suspected nickel allergy.  I bought 2 packs for my Stratocaster.  The high E string from BOTH packs SNAPPED at the head on the very first bend?? Threw on another set of EB's, the same exact way I have always installed my strings, and no problems.  I would think if there's a bad batch out there then Amazon would pull them from inventory.  Very disappointed. This product is cheap and thin. I was going to return but return costs $5.50! Bought another from GFS. Much better workmanship and grade metal. Been doing guitar work for 45 years. Used to sell for a few different string manufacturers. I do NOT like these strings. Bought them for a customer's guitar, her request. Guess what? I still don't like them. The Drum Dial dose a basic job of equalizing tension of the lugs on a drum. You still have to fine tune the drum. Where it really fails is it's durability. If it is dropped even a foot off the floor it will break and not calibrate (see photo).It feels solid but it's not. I would get something else. I've been using these picks since the 60's, Fender Heavy White picks. WERE my favorite picks, so I bought some here on Amazon to restock all the ones that get lost in the laundry etc. I opened up the package and plugged my guitar in and suddenly my guitar sounded dull and lifeless. I thought oh I must have the tone control rolled back, nope. I checked my guitar cord, the amp. I had a thought they changed something so looked at the package and sure enough, it now says MADE IN CHINA. So, I dug up one of my regular Fender white Heavy picks and played it and the bright biting tone I loved so much from these picks was immediately there. Shame on Fender for trying to maximize profits and cut out the American pick makers to squeeze more money out of us musicians. These picks absolutely are the worst picks I've ever tried, they absolutely kill treble response and any kind of liveliness. I thought, ok, maybe I got a bad batch, so went to Musician's Friend and ordered another batch, they were identical and sounded horrible too. This is the END of Fender picks for me, never buying any again.... Okay, so I can't comment on the sound or durability cause item came with its metal rim were bent.\n",
      "Usually, drum heads come inside a cardboard box but for some reason this item came inside a plastic bag.\n",
      "Wish there were another to swap it with.  Immediately returned it got prompt credit. The roll came damaged. Strings didn't last long at all, got some minor play out of them (about five 1 hour sessions) before one snapped and yes I know how to string a guitar, been playing for close to 20 years. I put these strings on my Gretch solid body, 70's vintage.  I love the full and varied sound I can get with this guitar, can play anything with it.  I don't play as much as I used to so I thought I would try the nanoweb coating on some super lights.  Hated the sound.  Not very full, and this guitar has very rich sound.  Almost tinny.\n",

Not only are the Elixers excessively bright, who knows what sort of disaster may be averted by not using them? Terrible. I know many people love the design, but I find it much too frustrating. You have to be very careful putting it on the fret correctly, then snap it in, then turn and turn the screw, oops don't let it snap off again and fall off while trying to turn the screw. Then you have to go through the whole routine again to take it off and move it to another fret and put it on again. What a farce. This is the worst capo I've owned, and I've tried nearly every brand and type. Yeah, I've had people show me how to do it right, and I know to do it right. It's just wrong to have to spend so much time slipping it on, snapping it, screwing it in, screwing it off, having it fall off, forget it, it's garbage to me. Also, while I'm getting my callouses worked out playing for two hours every day, the last thing I want is to pinch my fingers against metal trying to turn a screw. It's actually slightly painful to the fingers (momentarily, but why have to deal with that??) to work with. This design seems like it was a non guitar player who came up with it. The only good thing I can say about it is looks durable.\n",

These look cool, but they're brittle and break easily I hate to give a one-start review, instantly arousing suspicion as to the objectivity of the review, but this Capo is terrible.  It doesn't apply pressure evenly necessitating retune every time you use it.  It also doesn't have enough pressure at the open end to use on the first two frets of my Sheraton without one or two strings sounding muted..  The force of grip required to open it makes it prone to sliding out of your hand and snapping sidewise if you try to apply it quickly one handed.  It's also unnecessarily large.  I have a couple tiny planet waves dial-in capos, a couple generic ones like the Dunlop and a broken G7, all of which do a better job than this capo.

Not only are the Elixers excessively bright, who knows what sort of disaster may be averted by not using them? says it will do/fit a 12 string...... not the simon patrick 12 string made in canada...... the 12 string dwarfs the capo...... i need a large lengthy capo to play certain songs written with a capo..... always check for 12 and 6 on capo package as well as D shape neck vs other neck line figures..... will return...too pricy to have for non useable !!! ...What a piece of junk ! Tried on my acoustic 12 string and I cant get clear sound. Some strings buzz, The clamping string is weak...tried on my 74 Les Paul and it's worse. All strings sound muffled and it's because the spring just isn't strong enough..I already replaced it with a Shubb which is adjustable and works great on all my guitars. Sound not good on yamaha apx1000. As well as the coating it immediately got stain. There are those that love coated strings and those that don't so this is just my opinion. I put a set of these on my vintage Ovation. These strings sound coated and the Martin SP's I was using sound so much better. Plus after just one week of play there's material flaking off the strings. If you want a really good sounding acoustic string that's treated to last month to 3 months that doesn't have a coated string then try Martin Lifespan's. I love Lifespan but won't be buying anymore Elixirs. This thing is junk! The problem is with the tuning peg winder. It worked fine the first time I used it (changed a full set of strings on an electric), but when I went to change the strings on an acoustic a few months later, the tuning peg winder got unscrewed and came off the handle halfway into the job. This appears to be a permanent design flaw. Screwing it back onto the handle helped only for a few minutes before it came unscrewed again while being used. Manufacturer should have used some kind of fixed pin or rivet to hold it in place...something that would allow free motion without separating from handle. As a string winder, this tool is basically useless, or at least horribly flawed and inefficient. BUYER BEWARE! The screw holding the winder kept falling out.  A little superglue and it works ok.  It should work out of the box though. Found this product flimsy..unwind few turn and suddenly the pro winder just broke.. I was NOT shipped Fender Shell Guitar picks as shown in the picture. Instead I was shipped regular Fender celluloid guitar picks (different shape) which is totally NOT what I wanted. Boo!  Big thumbs down.  Don't send me inferior products thinking I won't notice! This tool has been disappointingly hard to remove pins with and dangerous to my guitar. Not sure why such a positive overall review.\n",
      "The sizes did not fit for wither winding my acoustic or the pulling up the pins- the tool is too small to work. Hate it.. the pic is all black.. got it in metal and black.. keeps squeaking when I use it.. and it's not smooth.. don't buy it! i Warned you The stand badly scratched and dented my beautiful Taylor wood guitar along the front surfaces of the two main top to bottom bars of the stand and on the front top two corners of the top piece of the stand.\n",
      "To fix the stand, I purchased some 1 and 1 1/2\" wide (maybe 10 feet long) neoprene rubber self adhesive strips made by Rubber Stuff Unlimited from Amazon and completely covered all metal surfaces.  It is fine now, after redesigning it and covering those abrupt surfaces and sharp corners.\n",
      "I recommend it but only only after you work on it for an hour or so.\n",
      "To repair the Taylor guitar, I pushed the dent back in as much as possible, 200 grit sanded it, and put a dab of water on each dent and scratch and waited an hour or so.  I learned this technique in college: the water helps swell the dents back up to level.  I sanded a bit more then I stained the dents and scratches with MinWax Wood Finish Stain Marker (from Ace Hardware).\n",
      "The stand holds the guitar conveniently.  However, it would appear whoever designed the stand did not use it on a wide range of guitars to foresee this design engineering defect. There are those that love coated strings and those that don't so this is just my opinion. I put a set of these on my vintage Ovation.

I'm not sure how it's possible.  I've already outlined below in my original review that these are not Jim Dunlop capos.  I had purchased two, which I have now given away to student players as I cannot use them.  I tested the capos on a standard acoustic and also an electric guitar.  The E string buzzes when the capo is applied and no amount of adjusting the capo would stop the buzz from occurring. Both capos had this very same problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I received these capos, I noticed right away that they were not the same excellent quality as actual Jim Dunlop capos.  The craftsmanship was visibly lower quality and the materials used are a lesser quality than official Jim Dunlop capos.  The rubber has a strong odor and there is no brand-name printed anywhere on the product.  As a professional musician, I need to purchase reputable brand-name products because I can't afford to have my gear failing during performances.  I have no idea about the future performance of these capos because they have no apparent brand, and no measurable reputation.  When I contacted the seller, they were not honest with me. Very flimbsy, can't get it to hold into place, and light is too dim. Honestly, it's junk. Not what I expected Did now work in my Mixdeck Q. I bought a set as they were recommended to get the tone I was looking for on my 7 week old guitar. Installed as usual and tuned them. They sounded good when played open but compressing them was nearly impossible. My capo could not even hold them. I set the guitar aside for a few minutes and heard the wood creaking. When I looked the face of the guitar was bowing up and the bridge was pulling up and back as if they were trying to pry it off. I released the tension on all the strings as fast as I could and left it. I returned them and got some lighter ones but to no avail. The body is cracked around the bridge and it is useless now. Use at your own risk!!!!!!! I personally wouldn't give a nickel for them. Been using Elixir polyweb on my acoustic electric.. Very mellow and balanced tone.\n",
      "Thought I would try something different. Also the reviews were very positive on the daddario. I can't stand them. Sound very metallic and extremely noisy when fingering and moving from fret to fret. They are so noisy, the noise is more dominate than the playing or melody. The polyweb are mellow and have a softer feel. Waste of money for me. Will go back to the polyweb. Only Lasted 2yr.  I have a lot of cheaper cables that get more use/abuse than this one that have outlasted it. Very poor neck output and strident bridge pickup.\n",
      "How can Fender sell these?\n",
      "Look up reviews online about poor performing neck pickups. ordered a twelve string set and got a six string set, not happy Twice recieved dead neck pickup Personally I love D'Addario strings, but I thought I would try something new so I got these. I myself didn't like the coating, or the sounds as much as the strings I'm used to... I actually hated these and couldn't wait to get them off my guitar, but they also sounded brighter, and I like a warmer sound. Strings are trial and error, so try them out for yourself, because a lot of people love these. Broke these about 20 minutes into playing my very first time. NOT ONLY THAT but I had massive blisters coming in where I shouldn't have had them due to the rubber gripping on to my fingers. This tool has the same aggravation as the previos version.  The wire cutter has no return-spring in the handle making the tool a PITA to use.  Open the handle... >snip< Open the handle... >snip< Open the handle...  ARRRRGH!\n",
      "\n",
      "Seriously guys, you have a great idea, now execute it properly!  I don't know why, but the picture made it look like they added a handle spring, but NOOO, Suckered again.  Now I'm stuck with it because it'll cost too much to return.  Buyer beware, you're better off buying a cheap pair of wire cutters than this 'pro' tool. I use capos a lot and this one was one of the worst.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, it worked well.  It fit comfortably in my hands when moving it, etc.  Then the side caps came off repeatedly until finally they were lost and every time I went to put the capo on my guitar, it exploded!  There is one large spring in the hinge that keeps the tension there.  without the caps on the sides it just falls out.  Terrible defect.

I personally wouldn't give a nickel for them. do not buy this pack if you're expecting a 3 sets of strings. what arrived was a single set (6 strings). unfortunately I was in a position where i needed them right away and had to go ahead and slap them on the guitar. Guitars: Taylor GA3-12 w/Expression system; Alvarez Baritone w/Fishman Rare Earth Blend pickup; Fishman Loudbox 100w Acoustic Amp.

      "Sorry, I tried these in lieu of my usual Elixirs, and will not use them again. They essentially died after about 2 weeks...went from \"boing\" to \"fump\". Elixirs on the other hand usually last up to six months before they start getting that dead, \"fump\" sound. I also picked up a set for my baritone guitar, and just for comparison mixed 2 of the bronze D'darrios with the elixirs...within a week the d'darrios were \"fumped\" and dead, while the Elixirs remained bright with great sustain.\n",

      "If I were a touring musician with money to burn, and a road tech that strung and tuned my guitars for me, they would be fine. It is true that new Elixirs are very bright in tone, while the D'Darrios have a nice warm tone at the start, but in my view, after about two weeks the Elixirs are broken in and keep a warm tone with great sustain for months after. It was not as described in the website. I used it for one day and the strings were already corroded. Don't buy it if you are looking for a corrosion resistant set. D'Addario XL and the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad strings! I've played guitar for over 20 years and have used all kinds of electric guitar strings. I thought I'd buy these \"cheap\" strings for practice, and use a higher end (NYXL) for gigs. Whoa, big mistake. Do yourself a favor and skip this low end product altogether. There's a reason they're cheap, and I'm thoroughly convinced now it's because they're made of the cheapest material known to mankind. After about an hour's worth of use, these things are absolutely toneless. These XL strings, after an hour of playing, sound worse than my NYXL strings that are 2 weeks old with more than 24 hours of bending, slashing, and strumming. Straight up, the XL is garbage. Period. I've played EXL110 for years and loved them, using hundreds of sets, but I think something most have changed with the production.  I've had three high E strings come unwound at the ball end in the past month.  All three were on gigs and now I'm stressed a set won't even make it through a whole show.  Come on D'Addario. The sound with this cable was great and I was quite happy with it for a year and a half.  After that, the cable stopped working.\n",

Ask any true audiophile or serious musician, and they will tell you: these are a complete scam, marketed to suckers.  Stop buying them. Personally I love D'Addario strings, but I thought I would try something new so I got these. I myself didn't like the coating, or the sounds as much as the strings I'm used to... I actually hated these and couldn't wait to get them off my guitar, but they also sounded brighter, and I like a warmer sound.

Ok! Ok! Let's talk about this case a year later. First I had to rip out part of the inside to make my mandolin fit. And that was a little too easy! Next the covering starts tearing away. A scuff mark goes right thru the cheap, very thin coating and then one of the four \"braces\" on the bottom when the case is flat breaks off. A year later it looks like it's been through a war, and it has! The Chinese seem to be purposefully flooding our economy with cheap defective items. I tried to make this work several times. Sometimes it would, sometimes it wouldn't, so it wasn't reliable. But it always had a very loud background hum while playing, regardless. This had such great reviews, so I'm really bummed out. I thought I might have just gotten a dud, but now that I'm re-reading the lower star reviews, there are plenty of others with this same problem.. Did not work at all I used this pickup on a Yamaha 441S and the \"quacking\" sounded like two ducks fighting. The highs, lows and mids all muddled together and the sound was just plain terrible.\n",

I've also been watching all his old interviews on YouTube and not once does he admit to the fact that he would have been nothing without this particular gauge of strings.  Nor does he cop to the fact that he used a plain 20 for the G string.  I am not impressed.  I will never play 13s again until I hear an official apology from his estate.  Music used to mean something, man. This was very difficult to use as a temporary fixture for going on and off a stage setup. Perhaps if it was fixed in 1 place for an extended period of time such a studio it would be helpful. After around 10 years of using these, I am finally switching to a different brand. The last 4 3set packs I have purchased came with at least 1 string deffective. Waste of time and money. Sometimes you can tell the string is deffective right away, but other times it takes a few strummings. This last one started to de-tune by itself brand new. not happy ... Its poorly made with attention to detail. I ordered them to fit on my dual mic clamp purchased here at Amazon. But they will not screw down all the way and are losse. It is useless!!! Other mic holders from different manufacturers work fine. I bought these strings to use for my 6 string to tune to drop B ..what I got was no 54 gauge string and 2 extra light strings !!! So I was disappointed ..won't buy again Got these for my kids guitar thinking they'd be easy on his fingers.  They're too thin.

      "Avoid... I tried two '68 Custom Deluxe Reverbs at home, and no matter how much I wanted to, didn't like either of them. The idea of having a vintage Fender Deluxe Reverb channel and a more modern channel (both with reverb and vibrato) is very seductive. The tone of this amp is exactly what I expected and was excited about, but three issues immediately raised their heads within the first fifteen minutes of unboxing both the amps I brought home.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first issue was the hiss, that godawful hiss you can hear even when the volume pots are at \"0\" and there's nothing at all plugged in to either channel. At \"0\" the hiss on these amps is comparable to the hiss you would begin to hear on the '65 Deluxe Reverb and about \"4.5\" or \"5\". For someone like myself who plans to primarily use this amp at lower volumes at home, the hiss was unbearable; you can easily hear it under everything you play at lower volumes and you'd need a noise gate in your recording equipment to get rid of it if you planned to use the amp for recording. If you plan to use the amp at higher volumes (beyond \"5\") and in environments with high ambient noise, then I don't think it's really an issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second issue is the ticking vibrato: Apparently it's quite common for the vibrato/tremolo in the 68 Deluxe Reverb to make a faint ticking sound that increases or decreases in frequency with the speed pot. In some amps it's apparently more noticeable, some less, some not at all, and in some it sounds like a faint whoosh (I heard it on three different amps). It's also an issue on the '65 Deluxe Reverb as well. If the Vibrato is turned off via the footswitch, the sound goes away entirely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, if you intend to use this amp at low volumes in a quiet setting with the vibrato engaged the ticking sound might drive you batty. It did me. If you want to mic and record with it at low volumes (the clean volumes), you'll be unable to get rid of the ticking when the vibrato is engaged. However, if you plan to use the amp in louder settings at high volumes, then you probably either won't hear it mixed in with the amp's natural breakup or it won't bother you. At home I could easily hear it while playing at volumes in the clean range under \"4\"; In the broken up range beyond \"5\" it blends into the overall sound while you're playing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fender is apparently aware of this issue and considers it normal for both the '65 Deluxe Reverb and the '68 Custom Deluxe Reverb. According to a little internet research there is a potential fix for the tick if you take it to a knowledgeable tech. Fender is even aware of the fix (I read they published a service bulletin for it at some point), but I guess they decided the expense or time/attention to detail involved in implementing the fix during the manufacturing process isn't worth it. That's sort of disappointing to hear. If there wasn't a potential fix and it was simply an artifact of the vibrato that couldn't be gotten around, I'd have given the amp another star, but I think Fender loses that star for apparently being cheap and/or lazy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third issue is reverb feedback. Id read about it in a couple of forums and only experienced it on one of the amps I brought home. What can I say, it was deafening, and occurred when both the volume and reverb were turned up beyond 5. Not actually something Id normally do anyway, but it happened and I got the full dose of what others have mentioned. Ive read suggestions where putting some padding above the reverb tank fixes the issue, but then why doesnt Fender do that at the factory? I also didn't experience this with the 65 deluxe reverb, so Im guessing it has to do with the modifications to this amp that increase its baseline gain beyond that of the 65.\n",
      "\n",
      "In sum, if you're chasing that clean Deluxe Reverb tone, also want a channel with a more full, modern tone, and either don't mind the hiss, or the ticking, don't use vibrato, or will be playing in situations where it's unlikely to be noticeable due to other ambient noise, and have some extra sound dampening foam laying about to cover the reverb tank, then, by all means, go for it. If you're like me and will be using it primarily at home or for recording and plan to use the vibrato, then I doubt you'll be excited at the prospect of paying over $1k for an amp with a bum ticker, a screaming reverb, and the vague hope that you can pay someone to fix it down the road (or take the time to do it yourself if you're skilled in that area). It's the sort of thing you'll either be able to live with and you'll love this amp regardless, or you won't. The many folks who give this amp high praise obviously don't mind the hiss, have had their hearing previously destroyed, or got lucky and have one in which the ticking isn't noticeable and the reverb doesnt feedback for some reason. For me that was far too many strikes against this amp, and I tried two from different stores and different manufacturing runs that both had these issues. i don't know if i just got a dud but, i went through 3 high e strings in 3 days. the first one snapped before it could get to e, the second one snapped while loosening the string (seriously!?). and the third one just snapped while sitting in high e. This is way over priced. Sounds awful. Thin with no punch. Guess I will go with another Dr Z.\n",
      "Returned this little dud. Need I say more...if it is dirty get it cleaned at a music shop. Ifyou play your horn a lot you will be best to bring it to a music shop once a year and pay the $30-$50 to get it cleaned. If you have a professional instrument it will cost more. I know these sound appealing and seem so much cheaper then a cleaning. Let me know what you think when they are stuck inside your instrument... inevitably these will not clean much at all and you will end up at the music shop. Purchased this Amp brand new but it had a faulty reverb tank.  Even at lowest volume and intensity of reverb, a noticeable spring buzz and growling happened at what seemed to be lower tone registers.  Never experienced this before in any of the amps I had in the past ever.  I am very concerned about the workmanship at the California factory.  Although the amp was stamped made in California, there appears to be components from other countries in it.  I'd like to know who manufactured the reverb tank.\n",

      "To test the reverb tank, I took it off the amp and sat the reverb away from the amp and put the tank on something other than the cardboard which it was seated on.  Same condition persisted.  Checked all tubes if they were loose as well and same condition.  Springs appeared un-damaged.\n",

I guess some amount of noise with the Princeton is expected to a degree since it is all tubes and RF interference can be problematic.  The question now is can I live with some of these issues if I will be recording this amp?  Time will tell.......One thing is for certain though.  If Fender had a chance to make a re-issue that was clearly not hand wired but PCB, then they should have made this amp much more quieter than the original.

Many people are having to do multiple returns to finally get one that works. This is clearly a quality control / manufacturing problem with Fender and not any fault of Amazon's or other retailers. So, I ended up having to order a different model (one with a good dependability record)  and will wait a year or so to see if Fender gets it's act together before trying one of these again.

I was replacing ceramic pickups on an extra-cheap strat imitation guitar Giannini G-100 (from Costco) and naturally expected much better sound out of genuine Fender pickups. To my great surprise, the difference in sound was marginal. I of course tested all three pickup with clean and distorted modes. The worst part is that these pickups are much, much noisier than the original Giannini pickups.

Sorry for the 1 star rating but it was just to get your attention. I am sure these are great pickups but I saw a Fender Custom Shop 69 Pickup review on Youtube. Joe states the bridge pickup of the Texas Specials is too bright to be even useable. I also find this to be true on my 1996 American Standard. After watching the video I am going for the Fender 69s for the same price. Just saying, watch this video before purchasing the Texas Specials. Nothing against Texas but 69' sound cooler too. LOL Checkout the video at: [...]  PEACE! The worst, low quality strings I have ever used in over 3 decades of playing the guitar. I've used several different strings in my lifetime, from GHS Boomers to Fender Bullets, to my only true love, Ernie Ball Super Slinky's, and I have to say these are the absolute worst strings I've ever played... here is why... They NEVER stay in tune on any guitar I own (and I've tried themon several, from ESPs to Gibsons, to USA Fenders). I am CONSTANTLY tuning these POS strings. One chord after tuning and the whole guitar needs to be re-tuned. Next, they stay bright for about 2 hours. These are some of the deadest feeling/sounding strings I have ever played. I know a lot of people will disagree with me, and I really do not know why so many people love these so much. I thikn it's because they are cheap and marketed well. Sadly, like I said... to me, worst string ever made. Makes sense I was buying these 10 packs for like $16. I decided to get this because I have 14 guitars and buying strings can get expensive. Plus these are the strings I prefer anyways. Had high hopes for it but even looking at the picture I thought \"I wonder how they get the strings to not bind up inside?\". The answer? They didn't. First string I went to grab was the low E. I followed the instructions and held the rest of the strings in place while pulling and it got stuck. Pulled as hard as I could without risking damage to the string and it would only come out about 6 inches...and then it wouldn't go back in. I tried another string, same thing. I now had 2 low E strings sticking out 6 inches from the box. I had no choice but to open the box up all the way, take apart the plastic spools inside, unwind ALL of the low E strings, and then try to wrap them back up again. The result? I now have 25 brand new low E strings with finger prints all over them. Thought my problems were over once I finished with the 3 wound strings. Nope. Sure enough went to grab a G and it got stuck. Took some serious coaxing to get it out. I would rather pay the extra money for 25 individual sets of these strings than ever get this bulk box again. They didn't even wrap each bundle of strings in protective sleeves either so by the time I use the last few sets they will probably be corroded and useless. Especially the low E's thanks to my prints. Basically what I'm saying is unless you are a guitar repair tech and plan on changing 25 sets of strings in one week do NOT buy this. Waste of money. I bought a set of 3 regular light gauge (.10) strings.  When I went to install the low E string, it must have been defective, because there was hardly any tension on the string I was winding when it broke just before the saddle.  I have included a picture of the break as a customer picture.  I was able to replace it with the low E string from the next set, however I'm still out a set of strings.  It isn't worth the hassle to return the pack, so I'm keeping them, but this'll probably be the last time I purchase from this brand. The Seymour Duncan website says it will fit in a sound hole from 3.85 to 4.25 inches in diameter.  The sound hole on my Seagull S6 is 3.875 and there is no way I could get this pickup into that sound hole without damaging the guitar.  And believe me, I tried.  And tried.  And tried.  I tried to the point where I damaged the finish on the guitar and broke the pickup.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do NOT purchase this pickup if the soundhole on your guitar is less than 4\" in diameter.  It fits fine in a Yamaha FG700S guitar I have that has a sound hole diameter greater than 4 inches.

      "One, i usually don't write negative reviews.. this one is important though because this product has taken away my favorite hobby for over a month now...\n",
      "\n",
      "Two, that in not an amateur player and have been around guitars quite a bit in my life so I know what I'm doing with guitars...  I've played and used MANY different brands and types of strings and until now my two \"go to\" brands for good strings at a decent price were DR & D'Addario (Thomastic Infeld's are the best IMHO, but they fall well outside of the \"decent price\" genre...)\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, About a month ago I needed some strings and since I had heard of the new BT sets from D'Addario I thought I'd give em' a shot....  I've regretted it ever since.... (I ordered the  EXL120BT's)\n",
      "\n",
      "To the point.....\n",
      "\n",
      "I install the strings, stretch them a little afterwards, tune em, clean/polish everything, spray a small coat of Fingerease and let it dry, etc...  My standard string install method I've used a 100x over or more with no problems or no noticeable issues...\n",
      "\n",
      "Then i start to playing....  (biggest mistake I've made this year so far)....\n",
      "\n",
      "Around 2 minutes into playing on the new strings (I use a few Gilmour solos to stretch the strings out after I install a set) I notice that my fingers on my left hand are REALLY starting to hurt, (especially my ring finger)....  When I stop and take a look at my fingers, I can see little tiny \"fine hair\" like metal splinters ALL OVER each finger, and a few of the larger normal sized splinters most of us have seen from time to time...\n",
      "\n",
      "Some are really small and difficult to see without a magnifying glass, and, others are your standard metal shard, but ALL hurt like %#!$@!!!!  ESPECIALLY when you touch anything with those fingers... (You know, like a guitar fretboard for instance)\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to today....  And I SWEAR that I am not exaggerating....\n",
      "\n",
      "I have not been able to play guitar since this happened due to the pain in my fingers, and I have pulled no less than 30 metal splinters from my middle, pointer and pinky finger on my left hand combined.... (I have finally gotten them all out as of about a week ago, which is around 3 weeks after the \"incident\")\n",
      "\n",
      "As for my ring finger, the last count on it was 63 metal splinters (most being the little fine hair-like ones that are difficult to see without a good magnifying glass and get out without precision tweezers, but feel like knife wounds when you touch a hard object) that I have removed...  There are still several in this finger of the larger type and are so deep that I am unable to get to them so far..  I'm going to have to visit a doctor for these most likely...\n",
      "\n",
      "Needless to say, I will NEVER buy another thing this company makes...  If you had gone through what I have (and still am), I can assure you that you'd be there with me...\n",

      "\n",
      "Don't say you weren't warned.... CRAP these strings are bad do not buy them if you play any kind of harder music or do a lot of string bends unless you like having strings almost take out your eyes then by all means buy em errrrr i always buy Ernie balls but i got cheap and tryed to save a few buck and buy 2 3 packs of these hunks of crap for under 18 bucks i should have spent the extra 7 bucks and got the 6 pack of Ernies I didn't even get a week out of them and they were rusted and poppin off left and right....................never again This power supply is Junk only lasted 1 hour of use. The power supply got so hot it melted the outer casing .I would NOT recommend this power supply and seller. I am glad that i checked the supply. I could have caused a FIRE.The customer service was not helpful ! The power adapter quit working after one day and Im not sure why. My Behringer adapter works much better so consider buying a different brand power source I managed to get through one night at a gig with these strings. I have been playing for 50 years and have used many D'addario strings and other products. These strings will not play in tune( and yes i did the intonation)!! After putting the strings on the guitar I noticed\n",
      "that 3rd string had a different tint from other 5 strings.\n",
      "Also it's thickness was nearly identical to the second string\n",
      "and sound it made was somehow out of place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other 5 strings were in perfect condition but I ordered a set of 6\n",
      "and expected to receive them all in a decent condition.\n",
      "I am disappointed, thus 1 star. Didn't come with the advertised BRL connector. Otherwise, I'm sure it's fine as a normal power adaptor. This item work for a week and then it stop working properly. It could have been the exception, I only want to share my experience. I had a Boss NS-2 and it works much better then M135.  I use strat with CS-3 and overdrive.  The NS-2 totally cut out the hiss and noise.  But this only cut out a little hiss, even I turned everything to the top. I though this was the case with the molded sides, but this has soft sides. Saxophones are too delicate to put in a case with flexible sides. I didn't realize it until too late to return and don't want to sell it and contribute to the detriment of someone else's horn. Very disappointed with description of this case. Stuck with two underwhelming soft cases and keeping MY horn it its original box. I Installed this unit in a local church on Jan 10, 2015. I was called back because one channel had a very low output. After cable testing all the cables, I noticed that there was a strong electrical smell coming from the unit and then it stopped working. Fortunately I was there to make sure that it was unplugged from the power. This is actually the third Behringer unit that the power transformer inside has burnt. It is not rated correctly for the power requirements of the unit. I have never had any problems with any other Behringer equipment, Just the EQ's. I did not expect that the device runs on 120 -volt electricity Alas and non-transferable to a 220 -volt electricity I play at a church that has colored lights and my amp buzzes quite loudly.  I tried the Ebtech and the only thing it did was cut my volume in half...the hum and buzz was still there. I bought this base on the five star review but overall I'm not satisfied. I have to turn it every moment to be tight and it keep becoming loosen in seconds. Just assembly for a try, only few rolls with music, it's had some hole on head, that's mean bad quality. buyer beware for this kind of. The features all work except the headphone jack - if I plug my headphones all the way in, it only plays in one ear (never had a problem with this on any other players with the same headphones).  I had to keep it partially plugged out but since I like to keep the metronome on my bass drum (so it's within easy reach), playing frequently knocks the plug off.  I remember having this problem when the first portable cassette players came out in the 70's but this is now a new millennium and this should no longer be a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with headphones (and I have isolation headphones) and the volume cranked to the max, I still had problems hearing it. Save your money get the pyle pro PDMK 7 mic kit its $125 has 7 mics which includes 2 condenser mics and works just as good as the over priced shures if you really need a SM57 type mic get the GLS ES-57 they are only $30 to $35 instead of $99 i own these mics myself snd use them while recording our own songs as well as clients in my studio don't pay for the shure hype and advertising First and foremost I want to say that I bought this hi hat stand from Guitar Center. I did not buy it from Amazon. But I can say that it was promptly returned the very next day due to its inability to function properly. The pedal is held by a flimsy little squeeze piece of metal in which couldn't stay on to save its life. Every two pumps of the hi hat pedal that metal piece would fall off and the pedal would start hopping all over the floor. It was a cheap piece of junk. Unless you are a child and going to break this piece of equipment do not get it. Its not worth the $53 that they're selling it for. Spend the extra 20 and go for the next series up. It doesn't do anything.  I wish I had complained and sent it back soon enough. Its burnt after 3 months of use. It did not stop the noise either. I was very disappointed, this hi hat came with a bad clutch new right out of the box. I bought this to use in our recording studio, fortunately Amazon took care of my return fast so we did not miss any sessions.\n",

      "Good music to all! this particular item did none of what it promised, I was so disappointed that I didn't even want to take the time to return it. I had an annoying humming in my computer to mix board connection, and when I unplugged the power cord to my computer; the hum went away, so I thought that this item would be just what I needed in order to get the crisp sound I desired for my online radio show.\n",
      "\n",
      "I purchased it, it arrived, I plugged it in, and the humming remains. There is a disclaimer on the package that states that we should call the company before returning the item, but I don't need a \"walk through\" of how to plug in to an outlet.\n",
      "\n",
      "I may call the company after my disappointment subsides, but I really wanted this to work. This product sucks! The hum noise got even louder and I had to take it out in the middle of the gig! Ridiculous price.  You can easily build one of these things for under 10 bucks.  Why do these companies shaft their customers?  Easy answer, greed. This makes zero difference. I have tried it in several applications. Unit arrived DOA.  Behringer has a bad reputation for quality.  So far I'm 0 for 2 on Behringer products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Avoid. Complete garbage. What little it did little to enhance the guitar sound was completely drowned out by the amount of noise it added to the signal. Returned it. I've owned a lot of guitar stands over the years.  I've always liked On Stage mic stands, so this caught my attention.  Reviews seemed good, price was right, so I gave it a shot.  Wrong choice...\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, the stance on this stand is very narrow.  How I didn't notice that in the photos, I am not sure.  Holding a guitar, it does not seem stable, at all.  If I'm using a guitar stand, it has to be stable, period.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, I'm not sure who thought the design of this locking retainer was a good idea.  There is nothing natural about trying to get a guitar out of this stand.  It takes BOTH hands, and you cannot do it quickly.  Compared to my Hercules and Ultimate stands, this thing just does not measure up at all.  Save your time and money... get one of those... I found that the note attack was crap unless I kept the compression all the way down. In the end I sold the pedal within a month of purchase. The Joyo compressor might be a better option to maximize your control. too noisy to use, I wanted to retire my 1978 model for this....Dunlop just can't get this right like my old one. I hate it. I'd bought two, too! They topple over, scratch the guitars, and just overall make me angry. Yes, they are sturdy at this price point. I just don't like them. yes you can tweak it so its less, but you have to cut back on the distortion level to do so. so then why have a distortion pedal? pushed all the way for maximum distortion and volume the hiss makes this pedal unusable for recording. a gate won't do the trick because it will hiss regardless if your playing. really dissapointing pedal from mxr. their phase 90 sounds great, this thing is crap. First: The pedal does not sound in any way equal to what it shows in his video demo dunlop, its gain is much lower. If you are buying it because you like what the demo shows don't buy it.\n",
      "Second: When you turn the pedal on it softens the sound, like if you were in a hole which is completely undesirable. for 50 bucks, it wasn't bad. I used it and loved it. unfortunately it shorted out and fried the board inside. I popped it open to try and see if I could fix it or resolder or anything, but no dice -- it was nice and toasted. not sure what happened, I always used a power conditioner and never did anything crazy with it. I am disappointed because it could have caught fire or damaged my other equipment if the case wasn't made as well as it is. for being such a useful device, why did it have to fry itself? I will buy another brand next time as well as steer away from all behringer products. if their preamp nearly caught fire, I don't wish to test their build quality on any other device. sent it back, not strong enough One word, FLIMSY. Crap! Broke within days. This thins is so loud and doesn't feel anything like a drum head.

It was to be used by a professional musician. We recently had a professional sound man check the mic and he feels that it is a defective unit because it doesn't work as it is supposed to in regards to the signal.  Unfortunately we found this out over a year after purchasing it and we did not purchase the warranty.  It was NEVER used during a performance and only tried out in practice and during sound check.  I would like to exchange it if possible. returned for me this sucked big time, if you want noise this is it. loud and ugly too Absolutely hands down without question or worth any debate in my mind the worst cymbal I have ever heard in my life.  My daughters toy cymbals sound better than this.  I know some people love these things but mine was terrible.  I even gave it to a friend and he gave it back to me with a similar sentiment. It's a good slide, but I prefer the Medium size. It fits perfectly on my little finger which is the finger I wear it on. Amazon doesn't carry the Medium size, so I got one from Music 123 (they carry all of the sizes). I also tried the small one , but that was too small.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love the clay interior, it's very comfortable. And the glaze on the outside produces very warm, buttery tones. I purchased this Dunlop \"Moonshine\" slide at the same time as ordering the Dunlop model 224 Heavy wall brass slide also size medium...NEITHER of these Two slides are a Medium size. I have slides from many makers that fit my Pinky perfectly and they are size Medium. I now own TWO USELESS Dunlop slides...How two mediums from the same maker can be different is totally REDICULOUS and lousy business practice. Buy Rock Slide for the best or Imperial Valley.... I'm Disgusted Fuzzy harsh fatigue I got a Jim Dunlop glass slide that was large and fit great, so I figured this one would fit also.  Nope wouldn't even get up to the knuckle on my ring finger. I bought this product in order to dry out my Selmer tenor saxophone. I carefully researched all of the available sax swabs out there and decided to purchase the Hodge product based on numerous highly positive recommendations appearing on the major internet saxophone forums. When I received it I couldn't believe how small the piece of silk is. I should have realized there would be a problem with it because Hodge was advertising it as a swab that can be used to swab out the instrument without taking the neck off. In order to achieve this the silk material is too small. It is superb for just the neck but for the rest of the instrument it is totally inadequate, I am now looking for a \"beefier\" swab that I can use for the main body of the instrument. The plastic coated weight is very nice by the way. I will keep it for just swabbing the neck which it does very nicely. My fault for not catching this before the order, but if you have gorilla hands these are the sticks for you. Not for me. Used once (for a few minutes)...sticks are giant and wicked heavy. Too much trouble to sell on eBay. Will never use again...now I know :-) Sounds terrible. Clashes so hard against all other sounds in my kit. I know a China should be \"white-noisey\" and kinda \"dirty\" sounding ... but this makes more of a CLUNK sound.... If you go in the trash and pull out ANYTHING made of metal, and hit it with a drum stick, it will sound AS GOOD if not BETTER than this cymbal. Even for the super low price, it's junk. Not only did both of these I received have non functioning notes but the pitch on the lower notes was questionable. I ended up buyin cheaper ones that were better ligature not large enough to come down nicely on the mouthpiece over a reed I've actually heard better sounding farts than this atrocity .. I have played guitar for quite a few years and have played and owned countless pedals and can honestly tell you this pedal is a complete piece of junk.  Upon looking at it you will first notice there is no \"Distortion\" or \"Gain\" knob to actually control the amount of distortion this distortion pedal produces.  This means it makes one sound and you get a 3 band EQ and volume knob, that's it.  That alone should be a deal breaker for most.  Now I admit this lack of control and versatility could be redeemed through a fantastic tone, but you will find no such quality here.  Do not buy this pedal, spend a little bit more on a different pedal or purchase a different pedal second hand for about the same cost as this heap.  Save yourself from future disappointment and regret. Nice lightweight case that fits vintage buescher sax and mouthpiece. Only complaint is that the Inside place for neck is too narrow and does not hold the neck of the sax. Returned the case. Obviously the item shipped to me was wired incorrectly and they don't make them ALL like this- or else the other reviews would be bad.  The pedal shipped to me has crossed wires.  With no pedal pressed, the sustain is ON, with the pedal pressed, the sustain is OFF.  Totally backwards.  I am mostly annoyed because i got the super(slow)saver shipping and waited two weeks to get a crappy pedal that i have to ship back- and then wait another few weeks.  Yay. Sorry didn't last a month !!! not good quality at all !!  couldn't hold my MXL studio mic clamp broke due to bad design and part made with cheap materials IMO !! Very flimsy, the white cover is all faded and come part on surface... I wanted a RFEAL one and couldn't get one just these cheap knock offs. NOT worth the money! The unit that I got, Made in Pakistan, was nothing more that a tourist trinket or childs toy. 4 Stars for a toy. Dull Sound. Floppy head. No tone to skin, jingles flat and clinky. Wood marred, poorly joined. Purchased several. Some were dead on arrival. Others failed after a few months. The pedal works in reverse.  It sustains without pressing the pedal.  In order to stop the sustain, you press the pedal.  Exactly the OPPOSITE way a normal sustain pedal works. There's a helpful review that is titled \"They break.\"\n",

      "Been teaching drums for 8 years. Sometimes the headphones are tossed aside after a student's lesson.... or on the ground (though I give them crap about it). Still, it's not like they're thrown with force. In about a month, one ear will go, the headband will tear and subsequently allow the earpiece frames to flop all over and just not stay put, and, the black plastic frame piece will break right off of the earpiece, or any combination of these things.\n",

      "I think the reason these isolate better is because they basically squeeze the head of the person wearing them... insanely tight. But that's the only positive about them. They seriously will fall apart. We've gone through about 15 pairs in 5 years... and still use the busted ones (gaff tape, etc) because we're just tired of buying them, knowing they will fall apart. I want my 2008 model Rhythm Tech tambourine to be brand new again!  It had a MUCH more comfortable handle and MUCH richer sound, too.  After so much gigging, it's showing wear, so I thought I'd replace it with another Rhythm Tech.  Unfortunately, I had to send this one back.....it sounds very cheap (more like Santa's sleigh bells than a true instrument) and also would have made my hand hurt.  The handle is wide where it should be more rounded, making for too open a grip.  And I have long fingers, too!  Sorry, this one's not for me. These reeds are utter crap! I've used Rico #2 reeds for a number of years because of their ease of use and that you don't have to blow too hard for them to work correctly. I went through this entire 3 pack in one concert and a rehearsal a few day later.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first reed made it through to the intermission of my concert and barely would work anymore. I changed it out during intermission to the second reed in the pack. Worked great for about 3 songs and then it too started not to work, and by the end of the concert was really difficult to blow through. A few days later I had a rehearsal so I tried using the 2nd reed from the 3 pack thinking I might have been tired towards the end of the concert. About 20 minutes into rehearsal the 2nd one died completely. So I changed to the 3rd reed from the pack. This one work for about an hour and then I could only get squeaks out of it. Ridiculous and frustrating!\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure I've run into one every once in a while that was bad, but not all 3 from the same pack... maybe it was just a bad lot, but I'm not very happy. Now I have to order more before my next rehearsal. I'm sad to see that Amazon is endorsing reeds from this seller. Just a waste of my time. Completely useless junk!!! Total piece of trash. Do not buy. It was not even good enough as a toy! It was not in tune! It was supposed to come with instructions. Mine didn't. It came in a crushed box.  Looked like I got a used piece of junk someone had returned!! The only reason I didn't return it was that it was cheap!\n",
      "I guess you can't expect much for $3. Two broke already - insides spilled everywhere. Wouldn't recommend it. Next time I will buy LP RHYTHMIX. I probably received a bad one. Rumor is Wuhan's quality control sucks so it's kinda iffy if your going to get a good one unless you personally get to test some before you buy. Which is what I suggest you do. I've heard Wuhan 16\" chinas that sound much better than the one I have. The one I have sounds pretty much just terrible, I try to avoid hitting it and will be switching it out for a better cymbal soon.\n",

      "Try to avoid buying these online. Find them at a local music store and test them out to find a good one otherwise you more than likely going to be disappointed. This stand was a bummer.  Opened it up and was hoping to use it as a stand for my Korg Monotron Delay.  Basically what I found out was that this stand won't hold onto anything.  It can't clamp on to the microphone stand....so what's the point of it?  It's worthless.  I finally managed to clamp it on to one of my mic stands (I have 3 different ones, it didn't work with any) and then I barely put my finger on it.  Guess what happened?  That's right, it came crashing down onto the ground.  Right now it's sitting on the floor, buried behind who knows what, and I'll never use it again.  A very very bad product, surprised it's a quik lok product. Won't fit a standard mic stand! The wing screw is so short that it won't champ completely on a narrower stand! Very heavy and not supported well by the small clamp piece! JUNK! Tried this on both an Atlas and an On-stage brand mic stand.  Opening is too small to fit the bottom portion of the stand and much too large to fit the top half of the stand.  Can't tighten \"Qucik-Lok\" screw enough to get it to stay on top half.  Did a quick, not to great fix, by putting a small piece of slit garden hose around top of mic stand, and then placing this stand shelf's clamp around it and tightening.  Do NOT recommend purchase of this item. This pedal is an incredible volume pedal that works flawlessly...but only if you're playing on clean.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a NWOAHM/Thrash guitar player I use a lot of very heavy distortion (high gain) and regular volume pedals just weren't able to tame the sound when I need it docile so I went on Musician's Friend, saw this and thought, \"a volume pedal designed for high gain? I'm buying this.\" I have never been more disappointed in a pedal since I bought an Original CryBaby (compare it to a Morley Bad Horsie and you'll be disappointed in the CryBaby too).\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand that for some, depending on the style, this pedal works admirably. But to the metal heads out there...DON'T BUY THIS!!! IT WILL NOT SATISFY YOUR THIRST FOR TOTAL CONTROL OVER THE SOUND (and sound level specifically)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only does it not adjust sound very well at all at high gain levels, the swelling/quelling of volume is completely flawed. It's as if the volume scale went from one to two to three to EIGHT with nothing in between leaving you with basically two possible volume levels: whisper quiet (it WILL NOT reduce the sound to zero. I guarantee), or full volume.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not buy this pedal. There are plenty of far better volume pedals, or you can do it the old fashioned way and change the volume on the guitar itself. I've bought a guitar stand and a mic stand from OnStage, and they have served me well. From the knobs to the legs, this stand is simple and reliable. The assembly was easy. Nice product. The only issue was that one of the top tubes of the z leg was warped, and so the 2nd tier couldn't fit in. It was an obvious defect that even my untrained eye noticed as soon as I took it out of the box. Shouldn't they check the parts before shipping them out? I wrote them a polite e-mail describing the problem two weeks ago, and I'm still waiting for a reply. I can't buy a replacement leg anywhere, so my 2nd tier isn't worth jack squat. This company doesn't have its act together. I'm not buying their products anymore. If you buy a stand from them, be ready to take your chances. Very disappointed in this product, especially since I believe they said it was the choice for studio playing!  I shook it a couple times and one end came loose, which caused the tiny beads inside to stick inside the rim.  I pried them out, pushed the lid back on as tightly as possible.  Today I tried it again and the lid popped right off, dumping a handful of beads on the floor.  I would think the lids on each end would have been sealed with something to prevent this.  Maybe a quality control issue.  Not sure if it's worth trying to return it. 4 frownie faces. This is one of the worst sounding tambourines I've played. It sounds like plastic hitting plastic. I got it for free, so I'll just give it to one of my little cousins or friends' kids. This stick is very big and not good at all... i bought this pack for my drummer... but he end up giving them to his friends Doesn't fit my stands did not fit my flt i ordered  wrong size wtf could also stand for \"wasted the funds\". What a waste of time and money. DOn't fit traditional stands. Don't know how such a super giant like Gibraletr could make a non-universal product. And it's kinda overpriced. There's more plastic in my kids happy meal toys. hmmm... Made a mistake on this purchase. Decided to save a little money over a high quality leather strap. The edge of this strap is very irritating on your neck. A bass can get heavy after a few hours, and this strap will scrape your neck until it is very red and irritated. Not a good design. Go to Walmart and buy a car you will get better quality Can't get intonation right have tried everything hang on wall it is pretty and I have set up my other guitars forever it sure didn't work for me I bought 4 of these, 2 for light and 2 for heavy cymbals. I bought them without having had any experience - just some youtube videos. Unfortunately the mounting mechanism that attaches the spring to the stand totally ruins the thread of the cymbal holder - even after one tightening!!!! I am glad I used it on a cymbal stand that is old and not one of my newer ones!!!! I never used any of these!!!! I read the reviews that deny this....... After buying it quit working in less the 3 days. i tried everything to make it work. Sent it back for good!!!  i went out and bought a more expensive Wittner Metronome model #831 dark brown, made in Germany.\n",
      "Don't waste your hard earned music dollars. I paid $41.00 for Wittner and I love it!!! (5 stars) Get what you pay for here.\n",
      "Pay now or pay later..... ??? Okay, maybe it's not fair of me to review the Qwik Time metronome because I got it free when I purchased a saxaphone (I didn't actually purchase the metronome).  The knob on mine won't turn to any setting other than 100bpm.  Other than that it seems okay.  It produces a tone at A440, clicks off 100 bpm or blinks a light at 100 bpm.  Does seem strange, since it's sold as a metronome, that no other tempo can be selected.  Short of that it works.\n",
      "  So, since I didn't have anything invested, I took it completely apart.  Battery out, circuit board out, arrow display decal glued to the center of the knob and sure enough, it is one molded piece with no ability to turn, EVER! I even took to it with a pair of pliers to be sure.  It's just a pretty picture that gives you the impression of select-ability. I'd be skeptical of any of their products now.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I stand corrected.  It isn't a knob.  The arrows are buttons which you push to go up or down in tempo.  Sorry I couldn't DISagree with the other reviewers here more! This silly contraption might be the ticket if you're a drummer - I wouldn't know, because I'm no drummer, but if you're a banjo owner hoping to use this device to set the head tension on your banjo, save your time and money! Its an absolute joke! This thing ships with two adapters, both of which are completely useless for the 1/4\" or 6-mm OD nuts on either American-made (SAE) or metric banjo J-hooks, so as soon as you receive it, you'll need to head-out to the hardware store or go on-line to locate another suitable adapter, and in all likelihood, you'll probably need to use a file or bench grinder to shave off some of the metal on that new adapter, just to make it work! Here's why . . . the diameter of the male shaft on both of the adapters provided with this lemon is 5.5 mm, and they both barely fit into the square female drive socket (or chuck), which means that the female drive socket on the device is approximately 5.8-6.0 mm in diameter. Thus, it will NOT accommodate a standard 1/4\" adapter (1/4\" = 6.4 mm.). This means that if you want to make it work on a banjo head, you'll need to locate either a 6 mm or 1/4\" male socket adapter, and then grind-off all four edges of the drive shaft until it measures something less than 5.8 mm in total diameter. Absolutely ridiculous! Not this fool! I sent this lemon straight back. Good grief! How tough would it have been for these fine folks to have made the female drive 1/4\" diameter??? Wake-up people! A good beginner guitar to play, fairly good construction of materials and for it`s large jumbo size, TONALITY-WISE, fair. this was bought for the Alesis Pad; however, did not fit and i returned it Looking back it appears that what is involved is a lack of quality control by Intellitouch.  While a number of people report the problems that I report, other people I know whose judgment and knowledge is impeccable report no such problems and adore them.  Some must be OK, but many must be crummy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Intellitouch Tuner's seemed to be the rage of Bluegrass and singer-song writer players around here about 10 years ago. They looked cool clipped onto the end of a banjo or guitar or fiddle.  They provided an image of the player as someone who was concerned with her or his tuning at every second of a performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "  A fool and his money were soon parted and I bought one.  I must say that I have about 8 different tuners for my guitars, banjos, and my fiddle. I find the Intellitouch to be the most useless one I have ever bought other than cheap 5 or ten buck tuners that don't last after a month of use.  I advise musicians who care about the grind of working on stage or playing at home to get a 20 buck kord chromatic and, if you need to worry about tuning up while band members or an orchestra is also tuning, get a cheap pickup clip for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The intellitouch's systems with arrows is hard to figure out and much harder than a simple meter dial.  It is really hard to figure out when it is on the other end of a guitar or banjo from your eyes and is too big to fit on a fiddle and not effect your playing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think if you need to know whether you are in tune WHILE you are playing by wearing one of these things, you really need to do some work to train your ears to hear proper tuning, and to school yourself so you recognize proper notes. You also need to figure out how to adjust the tuning gears and pegs on your guitar or banjo properly or insure that your setup is ok on a fiddle, or perhaps get a decent fine tuning tail piece for your fiddle.  If you have to lean on this strap on to do it, you just aren't doing your business right!\n",
      "\n",
      "The Intellitouches are not reliable at all if the battery runs down. Moreover, instead of using AAA, AA, or 9-volt batteries like most other tuners, batteries you can easily install and pick up in any store, these tuners use special batteries.\n",
      "\n",
      "I use tuners to check the intonation of my fiddle as I struggle to learn the instrument. I also use tuners to check the intonation of my slide playing on electric and acoustic guitar and on banjo.  Any tuner with a dial is much easier for you to get a read, particularly while you are playing or practicing than these intellitouches.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Of course, if you are either playing electric instruments or using a pickup on acoustic instruments, these tuners are useless.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The basic 20 buck Korg Chromatic has all you will ever need in a tuner. If you have to tune up in the middle of music or other musicians tuning get a little clip on pickup to clip to your instrument's bridge.\n",
      "\n",
      "  I have found that cheap no-name guitar/bass tuners have features these don't have like a setting to memorize alternate tunings.  Moreover Korgs and most other dial tuners have calibrations for you to tune with added cents which may be useful for the classical violinist trying to tune even tempered.\n",
      "\n",
      "  If you are interested in style points, particularly if you play bluegrass or old time music as I do, try the Gold Tone Bluegrass tuner that has all the dial functions plus settings for G banjo tuning, guitar tuning, and fiddle or mandolin tuning. I have owned (2) of these-they both ate batteries, and the second one had a connection problem.  Neither registered the low \"E\" well at all.  Never again. Way too small for my dulicimer as well.  Wish I had read the reviews before ordering. This guitar is horrible. I can't believe that Fender would produce such crap. I would say that this guitar is barely a notch above First Act guitars, that one can purchase at Target and various toy stores, in terms of quality. I could barely get it to remain in tune while I finished tuning the other strings. The neck is unfinished and feels like a tree branch that was just de-barked.  I like the idea of a 3/4 scale guitar for small children. But I can't justify the poor quality of this instrument. For just another twenty dollars one can easily purchase an entry level full size guitar from Fender or Gibson that will do the job and is much better quality. I purchased this for my 12 year-old daughter who is just starting out playing. I returned it and replaced it with a Les Paul Junior which she is quite pleased with. There were many scratches all over the face of the white portion of the guitar when I opened it from the box.  However, it does work. Trigger stopped working within a week... First all I hate gig bags hate em I bought one of these cases for a little Martin 3 years ago I liked it worked well got another one for another little Martin the other day took 3 weeks to get here an it was terrible the latches feel like if you open it a dozen times that will be it they'll break for sure 80 bucks is a lot for this case I got a regular full size case for 30 bucks off Craigslist an put a towel in it works great if you get one I hope it's better than what I got JUNK it's going back good luck These guitars look beautiful , especially the new FMT ones but BEWARE ! The pickups are terrible ! And the agathis wood is not very toneful. I had bought two of them, the first one the pickups were microphonic so they allowed me to trade for a squire classic vibe surf strat ( very good sounding guitar because of the pups but it also had flaws ) then i decided to try to buy another squier standard. Bad mistake ! The pickups work but they sound like you are dragging a hubcap across a tin roof ! Especially at higher gain. They build the pickups with quality plastic covers , stagger the poles , so they look cool , but they are terrible . The body, paintjob and hardware is good , and the necks aren't bad , but unless you are going to put an EMG or high output pups in, you won't get much out of these. Its a shame because they are nice looking guitars with 22 fret necks but they suck. They need to at least use basswood as the body wood. That is what my surf strat is made of and its a great playing guitar. If you are going to get a squier, get their classic vibe series- they still have a few flaws but are put together alot better.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as a side note, they sent me the wrong guitar - a squire bullet HSS and it was better sounding than the Standard i got ? Squier really isn't that great of a company. Their competitor Epiphone makes better low end guitars but strats are better looking.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best way to get a squier is to have it sent to a local shop and try before you buy. Completely defective. Not good The product itself is ok but these things were way too overpriced you can find other ones for much cheaper. Poor quality. After about 2 weeks of limited use one tone started failing. When I opened it saw that a membrane had broken off. A few others were already corroded. It's cheap but you get what you pay for. Zero quality all around!\n",
      "Why bother manufacturing and selling an item that is an insult to anyone with an ear for music? I have had to work with 2 ...They have short reeds so a great deal of metal is remove from each reed to get the tuning close on each note & close is often all you get. The reed plates thin and the plastic comb is weak, It bends [before breaking] much to easily, therefore the so a good air tight seal is not likely. Any entry level Hohner will be easier to play and last longer so will be a better bet for someone starting out. Junk Opening too big. Was unplayable. one of the pipes doesn't make sound at all, the rest are all sharp when checked against several  digital devices.  oh well $5 and plastic. kinda says it all I have been extremely disappointed in these strings.  I regularly use round core pure nickel (Pyramid Classics) strings, so am aware of the need to pre-bend before cutting them to length.  Never had a problem with other round core, but of three sets of DR (2 sets of .10s, 1 set of .09's) none of them were usable.  I could not intonate the A strings in the 10s sets, and the A string in the 9s sets buzzed all over the fretboard.  I wanted to switch to these from Pyramid since they are expensive, DRs are much more reasonable.  I'll probably try once more in the future, maybe I just got a bad batch, but two different gauges on two different guitars makes me wonder. Purchased thinking these would be good for my beginner son on alto sax.  The plastic may make these more durable but you cannot we them so you get an sound that is not entirely desirable.  Went back to regular reeds. These (I bought several) aren't that well in tune, and you can vary the pitch depending on the angle in your mouth and how hard you blow.  Spring for a few bucks more and get an electronic clip-on marvel! innaccurate, slow to measure, and the metronome subdivisions are actually wrong.\n",

It did not respond at all correctly on the head stock. Not recommended. This doesn't do a good job at all. I wish that i could return it! My advise to anyone is just don't buy it. WHAT A WASTE! I waited 6-8 months to receive this mixer because they didn't have it in stock, I finally received it on June 3rd, I try it the first time and worked ok, the second time that I used it was for a event at Church and I started using the effects, in the middle of the event the mixer started making this awful noise, I lowered all the volumes but it didn't stop so, I turned the main volume all the way down and it stopped, I turned off and back on and was ok until 15 minutes later it happened again, I turned everything off and tried at home the very next day, and the same thing happened this time I started looking for more specifics and the noise is coming from the main volume (white bottom) for the effects right above the blue sliding volume.\n",
      "I tried to returned but it was one day over the period that you have to return it so, now I have a mixer that is useless, because even that I turned that volume all the way down, you can still ear some distortion specially at church where you can hear pretty much everything. This is the first time that I rate a product with one star in my 20 years buying on line. item arrived defective intoduced a ton of noise into the sound. This board won't even push my speakers louder than a cell phone. What's Up With That Kind of works half of the time and then will go into convolutions and midi spasms.  Not just midi misfires or retriggers, I'm talking every note playing almost like an arpeggiator but totally random and not good.  Because it's passive (runs of midi power) and there is no panic button on it, I have to unplug all of the cables and let the power light on it slowly flicker off before I can plug everything in again so it \"works\" for however long before I have to do this again, usually 5-20 minutes.  Why do I have to do that?\n",

      "Not sure if I got a faulty unit or maybe its just a bad design but based off of what I have received here I would not recommend purchasing this device SAD and flimsy.  My Bad... Too much oil on it. Bought 5 packs on good review, Open tune \"A\" on National Resonator Guitar. Broke 2 BRAND NEW G strings (tuned up to A) while restringing. I know that this is a great deal of tension, however these are the FIRST strings that I remember ever breaking stringing or playing this guitar in over 10 years. Going to stick to my others, will not name brand out of respect. (brand starts with a D).\n",

Don't do it! junk, screw stripped, peg puller does not fit, cheap. get a much better one at G.C. for $1.99. These are horrible. The edges are rough and just don't feel finished. Took a Dremel to sand the edges so I could use them. Ended up giving them all away. Well, I should have listened to the bad reviews.  This is flimsy.  It's just not stable enough to hold up my guitar neck while I do string changes, cleaning, maintenance, etc.  I used it a few times and it's too frustrating.  Good idea, and nice design (the folding up is great for storage).  But not good execution. This is a cheap-feeling plastic and is too light to adequately support my guitar.\n",

I am sending this back at a loss to me just to get it out of my sight. The Stagg Table Top is a far better table top stand and for only a few bucks more.

Spend a little more and buy a better quality product In a month the clamp looked horrible the strings came off looks bad to present to others the good thing that it does its job my mic is still holding up but with time it looks horrible I bought these for my Martin D-18. There pins are made in Mexico for Martin. They are cheap plastic bridge pins that cost about the same as Martin's solid wood ebony pins. I would recommend skipping these and buying the solid wood pins. If you want white, you will need to search for bone pins that cost about $25.00. I've been a user of Dunlop Tortex triangle picks for a long time and decided to try these. The material makes your fingers feel sweaty the instant you pick it up. The recessed part in the middle is supposed to help you grip them better, but it is textured in such a way that it actually reduces the surface area touching your fingers and it's actually more slippery than the untextured outer edges. The only way I could get these picks to be somewhat usable was to scratch up the surface with a knife so as to be actually grippy. I noticed that some people find Gorilla Snot messy.  You may want to try Monster Grips.  I love these!  They're very tactile, they provide a great grip, and they're not at all messy.\n",

This is the most messy crap ever.  It gets everywhere!!!!  Im going to stick to stick wraps Yes, it is sticky and the name is cool.  When, I perform, my picks get really slick when my hands sweat, and they move around between my fingers.  This was not the answer.  Everything gets sticky, and the picks still move. Amazon processed the refund quickly, so that was cool. The bag came broken, with a zipper that was off the track. The bag itself seemed nice, but the flaw caused the return. Regarding the size of the bag, it's pretty small, so you may not get so much in it. It reminded me of a laptop case, maybe five inches bigger on each side. Of course, that won't work for most of you, but if you have very little to carry or transport, it may be ok. I bought this to replace and old SKB case that looks just like it which wore out after 2 years and is coming apart. I immediately returned this bag, there is no way, I was going to carry around a 1400.00 effects system (AX8) in this flimsy bag. This is basically like my kids backpack, there is very little padding and nothing at all rigid to protect what's inside of it. The SKB bag wasn't the most sturdy thing in the world but it was much better than this bag, so I will be purchasing another one unless I can get my hands on an aluminum case instead. I bought this because it obviously has great reviews, but I'm growing more and more skeptical about these reviews of these products, as this is obviously bogus information on this product. So this was my first condenser and having no prior experience I thought it was great until finally about a year later after really trying to use it I discovered my recordings had this terrible hum which turned out to be electricity and the mic not being grounded. I would touch the metal mesh on the mic and the hum would get crazy loud so here I was crazy trying to find solutions on how to ground my laptop or mic or whatever it was coming from.. instead the mic just broke and began to crackle and pop... it was ruined. So now I buy an Audio Techinica 2035 and VIIOLA... absolute pristine recordings! Absolutely no hum! Beautiful rich sounding! I've learned my lesson now and I would NOT suggest this mic. Spend the measly extra 40$ and get a TRUE honest and superior quality Audio Techinca or something else other than this. I'm so happy with my new mic now I can't believe what I was working with before. These mic's are not even true large diaphram microphone but the 2035 is AND it came with a stage stand, a shock mount, a leather pouch, AND quality xlr cable for 141$ on ebay! So if you want true superior hassle free quality go with a 2035 in this price range. I feel like I just graduated into a higher class within 5 minutes of owning and testing it... no hum at ALL. These picks are tiny. Dunlop sells 1.0 and 2.0. They give you a ridiculous item # - \"474P2.0\" and we are somehow supposed to know their relative size. I purchased the 1.0mm version at a store. They were red and somewhat smaller than the garden variety guitar pick. The 1.0 is great because it is nearly frictionless. I was surprised to find I could play a lot faster than with a standard pick. That said, I thought a heavier pick would work better so I ordered these. As I said, they are tiny, and about half the size of the 1.0. If I wanted to go to their website and \"research\" the varieties and sub-varieties of picks Dunlop offers I might have known this pick is a different series. =OR= Dunlop could have simply provided a photo showing me the relative size of the pick here, where it would be useful.  So the rating is because it is half the size of the pick I thought I was buying. Returning. TOO STIFF I ordered this cable after reading all the positive reviews.  Cable shipped quickly, had it at my door in two days.\n",
      "I was excited and ready to test it out, take it for a test drive if you may say. I made my connections and almost immediately, I got a hum out of my amplifiers speakers. I tried a different amp with no success.  So, I put back my original cable and the hum is no longer there.  This cable is horrible, however if you are into the hum scene, go ahead and purchase one.  I will say this about the cable, it does look like it is solid or put together nicely.  Too bad, I am getting this hum, I was looking forward to to hearing my daughter sing.\n",

      "I am a technical person, have been a systems consultant for 30 years, so I know a little about cables. I really wanted to like this guitar.

      "\n",
      "First of all, the good things. It sounded good, really good, what with the P90s and the fully hollow body. I think the Casino Elitist sounded better, a little richer and more solid, but it was close; really they were both good sounds, just different, almost coming down to personal preference. And the action felt good, too, low and fast. The quality of the woodwork was good overall, except for a clumsily-cut curve in the headstock, which disappointed me because, to my eye, this nice little arc carved on each side of the headstock is part of the iconic design of the Casino, a nice little detail that sets it apart from its Gibson cousins. The polyurethane finish was well done, smooth and even.\n",

      "But the stain was another story. It was applied in blotches, and you could see streaks and sponge marks where the stain had been allowed to dry too much before wiping off, or something of this nature. Streaky, ugly, blotchy. Not good.\n",

      "But the frets were the deal killer. The fret job was abandoned halfway to completion. Maybe they thought nobody would notice. Maybe a lot of people wouldn't. Here's what they did: the frets were pressed into the fingerboard, the ends smoothed off, and the frets were leveled with a file or belt sander. Then some worker began the job of crowning the frets with a fret file . . . and there it ended, throw the guitar in a box and ship it out the door. The crowning was never completed, so the tops of the frets were not properly rounded, but were left way too flat, too wide. And the file (or belt sander) marks had not been sanded smooth, so the harshly flat tops of all the frets had ridges in them like corduroy! Imagine what that feels like when you play it. Bend a string and instead of a nice smooth feel--and sound--you get this grinding feel, and a grinding sound as well. It was kind of funny, kind of funky in a dime-store cheapo guitar way, like some $29 Woolworth guitar one of those old real roots Chicago blues guys might have played back in the '50s . . . but for a guitar at this price point, a guitar that's trying to be a real grown-up guitar instead of a toy guitar--this is completely unacceptable. Laughable really, deserving of scorn. Where was quality control? Or is this the standard the once-proud Epiphone company has set for itself? I will never know the answer, but I do know I will never risk buying one of these junkers again. It cost me over 80 bucks to ship this guitar and case back to the online store I bought it from--they shipped the guitar and case separately, so two boxes, two FedEx bills--so, expensive experiment.\n",

Don't buy this garbage. I love Planet Waves. They are cheap and decently durable. They aren't top quality and will eventually wear out, probably faster than more expensive ones but they will a while. I always get the cords that have the 90 degree angle on one end which will help with the wear and tear.

Every time it touches itself it makes a tapping noise through the amplifier. You can clearly hear it when you plug it in and if you take a loop of the cable and tap it against itself, there is audible noise. It also seems to pick up stray RF and causes the amp to be noisy.\n",

In fact, it died just after the return window closed with Amazon, so I contacted Planet Waves about their lifetime warranty. I was notified I'd have to ship it to them at my expense in order to get a replacement. Being that it would cost nearly as much to ship it as I'd paid in the first place, I decided to take the loss and move on. I've had good results using other Planet Waves products, but I won't be purchasing any more of their cables. Totally unreliable. The cable died on me in less than a month. Very disappointed in built quality. Bought two of these. Both failed at pretty much the same time, within a year. Both used in controlled conditions, on dry rehearsal rooms and stored carefully, they both actually look almost new, but don't work anymore. Save your money and look for something else. Second one I bought. Lousy build quality and only lasted 3 months. Went through two of these before I learned my lesson. Don't waste your money on this junk. I love Planet Waves stuff normally, but these are junk. After five months of light home use mine quit working.  It loses connection after being plugged into the guitar for a while.

Not a fan, but what should I have expected for a chord that was less than 10$ cable shorted out after 1 month of light use I got a couple of these....only buy this cable if there is NO CHANCE that it will be ever used in the real world....\n",
      "after only a month mine has developed a nasty short in the plug....and of course , since this cord is molded/sealed up tight , it can't be repaired.......you could cut off the plug and solder a good 1/4 inch plug on it...but why bother.?....just save your headaches and money and buy a good heavy duty cord....this cord is too flimsy......its junk with a fancy molded plastic ergonomic looking plug  housing...but inside its junk....thrown away money.!!!.......buy a lottery scratch off instead,,, Dont last but a couple weeks..terrible feed back as the ends near the plugs detirorate quickly. Will never buy again even if only 5 bucks Well this cable certainly didn't last long as the title says 8 weeks.  Bought a new Fender Mustang2 v2 amp a week and a half ago.  Last night amp would turn on but wasn't putting out any sound from the guitar. Messed around a bit and it started to work.  Today same thing and it's obvious nothing is going from guitar to amp.  Thought I had a bad jack in my new amp and wasn't very happy.  Got out the old amp and guess what nothing there either.  At least my new amp is working and I only have to replace a $12 cord.\n",
      "Maybe I'm just unlucky and got a bad one and if I bought it at a local store I'd return it.  Not going through the hassles of mailing it back or asking for a refund.  Will just move on to another company's cord. Guess anyone can get a bad cable. Just bought this and never got to use it cause anytime you moved it it lost connection. Looked like the molded ends would be good in the long run. I bought a 20' GLS audio cable that is working fine right now. My friend calls them Iron cables cause that's what they look like. It had the fabric like the old electric irons had back in the day. This cable feels cheap when you hold it. The diameter of the cable is rather small compared to some.\n",

This one is sure to ruin your night if you don't have backup. Based on the number of positive reviews, I bought the 20ft right angle version of this product to use with my Fender Jazz bass.  When I received the cable, I was a little concerned about the light gauge and feel of the cable.. but hey, it got great reviews.. so why not?  I used the cable last night and my signal faded ... repeatedly.  I wiggled the cable and got the signal back, then it happened again.. no signal.  I pulled out several of my backup cables and tried them all and had no loss of signal or cut-off.  I tried this cable again.  Same loss of signal.  I'm returning this cable, as I can't even recommend this product as a backup cable since it is unreliable. This cable is of very poor quality.  Constant buzzing, and loss of sound depending on the angle of the cable.  Don't waste your money. I have no idea what bass these will fit on.  I tried to use them on a Hofner Beatle bass, and the blue fabric at the end of the strings was going to end up in the nut.  So I had to send them back.  Don't buy these unless the scale of your bass is about two inches shorter than that of a short scale violin bass. thanks Hated it.  Really, really stiff.  Not flexible enough. if you don't fill it up all the way, the picks start to fall off Arrived in pieces. Not useable. i found this item to exspensive for just one i hope that the people selling this would atleast make it a two pack Awful, second one I bought and became defective within less than 3 days of normal use. I have straight ones I've not had a problem with, but these L shaped ones just seem to go to cr@p right away. Don't buy this garbage. Terrible design. The picks fly out like confetti when all you want is one pick. They have another model that is bigger. That one works better. This one is useless. Can't believe I bought two of em. Save your money. I love Planet Waves. They are cheap and decently durable. They aren't top quality and will eventually wear out, probably faster than more expensive ones but they will a while. I always get the cords that have the 90 degree angle on one end which will help with the wear and tear. I bought a few of these to use in a church environment and things get abused more than I'd like, so far they have held up!\n",

      "*****REVIEW EDIT***** These are not holding up as well as they usually do. Since, the review all of the cords that I purchased have broken.  I bought them right before Christmas 2015 and now it is Easter and they all have failed This cable is junk. It's very noisy. Every time it touches itself it makes a tapping noise through the amplifier. You can clearly hear it when you plug it in and if you take a loop of the cable and tap it against itself, there is audible noise. It also seems to pick up stray RF and causes the amp to be noisy.\n",

I may have received a dud but my picks fall out when I hang my guitar or lay it down. The tension on the spring is so loose. Even when I load it up with picks it's loose. I'm going to try to adjust it when I get time but I was not happy with mine. Luckily, it was just an add-on item. I know you will occasionally get the one dud and other customers may have had better luck. I usually do not ask for a refund or stir up a stink over a low cost item and I won't on this purchase. I'll make it work somehow. Just be aware that you may have the same experience. I agree, worthless. You can put them in -- but if you have short nails like I do, no way to get them out. Worthless.  Would give it zero stars if I could. Save your money. After 3 months, this cabel has developed a fatal short. It's unusable. The Amazon dealer won't take it back. Now I have to see if it's worth chasing the manufacturer for a return or replacement.\n",

I will now spend about half of what it's worth sending it back to D'Addario to try to cash in on the 'lifetime guarantee'. Cable broke. Stiff leather and hard uncomfortable trap. I gave up putting strap locks on these and bough another brand strap. Stupid item, its huge with a folded metal 'spring' that takes up all the room inside. You can put one pick in it!!!\n",

I love Planet Waves stuff normally, but these are junk. I've been playing guitar for 30+ years and have tried many capos. I used this for one day and it's been collecting dust since. Although the concept seemed nice to me, using it leaves a little to be desired.  When resting the capo on the nut of the guitar and sliding it down, more times than not it will pull a string or two out of tune.  Depending on neck thickness, in my opinion it applies too much pressure, again, causing strings to go out of tune. The overhang of the capo can get in the way at times, especially at your high e.  This of course depends on your playing style.  You might also consider the springs, roller contacts, they will wear in time.\n",

      "If I were to recommend a capo, I would suggest the Shubb c-1, you can adjust the pressure to be \"just enough\" without taking your guitar out of tune.  It's compact, very easy to use and quick to install. A huge point, it does not get in the way.\n",

MADE FOR BIG STRONG AND BIG HANDS MY HANDS ARE SMALL I CANNOT GRIP AND HOLD AND MAKE THE RELEASE At THE SAME TIME. Being as female, I assume this design is made for males only? I have other female friends who cannot work the clips either. I ENDED UP BREAKING OFF ON OF THE CLIP END SO I COULD USE IT> NOW I CAN GRIP AND HOLD AND RELEASE WHEN NECESSARY> EXCELLENT IDEA, POOR DESIGN. Clasp almost impossible to open, plus it's made backward from the instructions that show the female end is on the guitar, but it won't fit because it is manufactured wrong, the short string is on the wrong clasp so instead the ugly three prong male end dangles on the guitar and bangs against left hand every time you move to an open cord.\n",

It has a different logo on one side of the clasp as if it were from a different manufacturer.  I'm trying to decide whether $3.95 is worth the effort of sending it back. I bought these so I could have an extra set of string as I needed them.  I went to put these on and the E string unwound!  Really?  The biggest string?  Now out of Amazon warranty, and I have to see if the manufacturer will replace or refund.  Garbage! terrrible smell kinda like a burning fire smell I really don't like it, Ive gotten froggys fog swamp juice instead and that one is a bit pricier but it smells alot better and stays alot longer and is way thicker I was very excited to try out the Dean Markely ProMag Grand Pickup but I have to say I'm extremely disappointed. It is nearly impossible to play without getting a loud tapping sound not just when using a pick but also when finger picking. I tried moving the pickup from the bridge to the neck side of the sound hole and every point in between but I cannot find a position that this annoying  sound is not present. Dude, horrible pick up. Maybe I got a bad unit but this \"Flanging\" effect or whatever it is sounds horrible. If you want to record a track 500 times than go ahead, other than that, spend some more money for a better pick up Don't buy this item! Arrived broken.

Dead on arrival; even tested with three different amps. yes you can tweak it so its less, but cant even use it for recording with or without an amp so much hiss its unusable. The pick arrived in a box large enough to hold about 1000 of them...so much for \"go green\". Though listed as large, it was much to small. It was also split. I am just to busy to return it. this thing does distort your tone and doesn't sound good. I read reviews on here before getting it, and though there are many bad ones, many of them, lol, I went ahead. that was a mistake. it distorts, it muddies and makes your guitar sound worse. sad cause mxr have a classic delay pedal, the carbon copy, and their distortion pedals sound cool and I plan on getting the metal one, fullborne? fullbore?\n",

      "anyway, thankfully I returned it asap and am now going to get the tc electronics helix, which I recommend anyone planning on getting this one do. check out vids on youtube for the tc helix, it sounds great and has total control, while this has one knob, one!!!! the helix has speed, depth, feedback and mix, which is awesome, plus you can get custom made sounds via computer somehow, which while not a selling point for me, I'd rather make my own sounds, is a cool addition. so in short STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE. I have several MXR pedals. Every one is superb--except for this PHASE 90 (the non-\"script\" version reviewed here). This PHASE 90 is worthless for anyone who wants to use it while playing clean, for it adds a tsunami of irritating distortion, a swoosh of sonic dirt. I did some research and discovered that other people who also hate this pedal's distortion suggest some modifications. (Look up \"MXR Phase 90 Mods,\" and \"Erik's Corner\" will show you how.) I made the \"R28,\" \"C11,\" and \"C12\" modifications. The result: a slightly improved phaser, one that still churned out plenty of distortion. Finally, I tried adjusting the internal trim pot. On no setting could I get rid of ... you guessed it: distortion. I spent literally hours in a futile and frustrating effort to make this pedal sound merely acceptable. No luck. BOTTOM LINE: IF YOU WANT A PHASER THAT DOESN'T ADD SIGNIFICANT DISTORTION, AVOID THIS INCARNATION OF THE PHASE 90. Okay,  Color coding is a GREAT idea.\n",

I got this cheep \"MADE IN CHINA\" 20 buttons Hohner Concertina new from a local store more than a year ago..... played for about 2 week and I had to leave it inside the clothset because it has 2 sticky button and 1 button can't even pop back. The air button sometimes didn't even work. The F reed (control by the right hand side top row 3rd button)its tune is kinda between E & F and the C reed (Right hand side top row 1st button) is C#. That's why I let it sleeping there.\n",

      "I think its the reason of MADE IN CHINA. I paid less and get less quality. Attempted to put one on an SM58. As soon as I started to slide in on it split into 2 pieces. Utter junk I wasn't able to begin to get this item onto my Shure SM58 without tearing it.  Other reviewers have regarded the tight fit as a feature, but to me it it a big defect.  I take the windscreen on and off as conditions dictate, so I don't want to have a fight on my hands every time I need to make a change.  The picture shows a comparison of a Shure windscreen and this item (note the tear on the right one. Do NOT use these to polish your guitar. It leaves tons of small fibers all over, and is hard to clean up. A total disaster. These are good for maybe wiping up dog poop, but not cleaning anything. I have always used the Dunlop Mudslide large. I see here that Joe Perry is a little cheaper so I am trying a different one. I play cigar bix guitar and don't need long but large standard size is about $7 more than long. I hate being ripped off but I love porcelain. I reluctantly bought long so i can use it on a standard 6 string. Still the price difference makes me an unhappy customer. To hard to bend. I was unable to rate the quality of the pedal because it simply did not work at all right out of the box. Neither battery or adapter power made any difference. Might work for extremely light weight microphones, but my application involved using it with a wireless mic and it could not keep it in an upright position.  the mic kept dropping down and resulting in several complaints. Will not be buying again or recommending to anyone. Tore, just trying to get it on top of the microphone. Don't buy. meh its a foam ball for mic what do you expect If I hadn't damaged the box unpacking it, I'd send it back for a refund. Flimsy, unstable, and unless you're putting something like a small Fender Blues Jr. on it, it'll fall forward on you. This is quite disappointing considering most every other On-Stage item I've purchased over the years has been pretty decent. Not even close to worth it. It creates a crazy amount of buzz when used and it destroyed my favorite distortion pedal. Don't chance it, get an adapter that isn't trash quality Comes from China. I'm sure it's composed of all kinds of harmful toxins. And it takes over a month to receive it. Kum Pow! The threads were bad on the gooseneck I received and I will have to return it Cheap, the end came off the first time I used it. Sometimes you don't even get what you pay for. To much hassle to return It broke on the first gig.  Very flimsy connection in the middle.  A small child could break this in half with his or her bare hands. I ordered two of these and both were defective and needed to return.  It created a hissing noise and it required the volume to be turned up more than necessary.  I compared this to an existing converter which had no problems.  Thankfully, Amazon returned these adapters with no problem and refunded me.  I will be looking for another company to purchase these adapters from. I got this thought I would use it untill it came and the packaging said there are chemicals in it that cause cancer .. I purchased 2 of these items to use with my band for the guitarists. I was disapointed when I mounted a Shure sm 58 mic on it and found that the goose neck would not stay erect. These are made far too loose and flexible for most professional mics. They may work on very small and light weight units but for my needs they are totally unuseable. It would have been helpful to include the suggested weight that this goose neck would support in the sales description. I wasted my money. Don't waste yours. Perhaps viagra would be helpful ;-) This arrived and when I tried to use it, it turned out that the male threads were some  oddball metric size that does NOT fit any standard adapter.\n",

      "  This is such a standard item, that there is no excuse for making it with non-standard threads, and NO excuse at all for advertising it as standard 5/8ths... This product is terrible.  It cannot hold the weight of any microphone over 1 lb, and I would question that, based on your angle of use.  It is terribly made with flimsy construction and I do not recommend its purchase.  Look for a more sturdy built construction gooseneck mic holder.  They are out there, it's just not this one.  Fortunately Amazon was great about their return policy, which I appreciate.  Thank you Amazon for at least having a positive return experience. I bought this power supply for my OCD full tone distortion Pedal. I quickly ate through a 9 volt battery and decided to get this based on the recommendation from Guitar center. I got home I I plugged in the power supply to the OCD full tone distortion pedal and instantly I heard an added annoying \"hum\" almost a buzz static sound coming from my tube amp. I tried moving the power supply away from everything else and no luck the \"hum\" or buzz sound remained. I thought the pedal cost me $127.40 and I didn't buy it to hear \"hum\" noise. That being said this product does not do what it is supposed to its going back to guitar center! I will buy the voodoo power supply 2 in the next few months. I purchased these with the hope they would be an improvement on the short goosenecks that came with a recent purchase of Amp-Clamps; a wonderful invention that allows proper micing of almost any guitar amp without using a stand.  Instead, these are really pathetic.  They resemble a gooseneck in appearance only.  They will not hold any shape more extreme than a useless 5 degree bend.  I find it hard to believe a human being actually was involved in quality control of this product.  Utterly worthless for the intended purpose, they will either be returned or thrown away.  I have not been impressed by anything made by On Stage but this product sets a new low.\n",

      "Save yourself the grief of being suckered into purchasing these. Terrible Design. It kept popping out pf my microphone input. I couldn't use it and had to return it. Will never order again. Poor quality, the quality of sound significantly diminished when this adapter was used. Contains stuff known to cali to be dangerous. I'm good. Got it as part of a bundle and won't be using it. Didn't fit my yeti. I put it on the mic, but then stood about 20 feet away, because I didn't want to catch whatever it gives you, but I couldn't hear anything on the mic, so I don't use it.

So I returned it...be careful, the price is a ripoff for one string... I was COMPLETELY RIPPED OFF by Amazon. This product is a JOKE and it makes me think Amazon is a complete waste of time.

That's right, 5.30 for FIVE strings of the same guage (013mm), from D'Addoario. Then I looked for a package of 17's to function as my B string. The first result was this product. I didn't pay close enough attention. Surprise. Lesson learned: while the 5 pack of PL013 D'addario strings cost 5.30, the PL017's that came up as the first search result were NOT a pack of 5, but a SINGLE STRING! For over six dollars. The two strings are not appreciably different, mind you, so the price difference is very misleading. The 17 is not wound, which might justify charging a little more (but not that much more). They are both single pieces of wire made from the same material and produced by the same manufacturer. The only difference between them is four one-hundredths of a millimeter.\n",

If you're worried about breaking your high E string, it's better to have 5 spares instead of just one, especially for the same price! pure junk! I also saw the large picture at the top of the page which plainly says 5 strings are enclosed. Be aware there is only one. I'm surprised Amazon would allow such a deceptive page.

The binding is well done and both the bridge and fretboard seem to be decent quality rosewood . The tuners a sealed , turn smoothly and don't have any wobble .The nut and saddle look like some kind of synthetic bone and both look to be slotted and seated correctly . The neck is slim and feels very comfortable in your hand . The body size is a little smaller and slimmer then a standard dreadnought and sits/hangs nicely while playing either standing or sitting .\n",

      "Now to the problems . The string action was crazy high right out of the box . Combine that with severe fret buzz at the first three frets makes the guitar unplayable . A closer inspection reveals that the second fret is ridiculously high and needs to be leveled and crowned . I simply can't believe that this guitar was allowed to leave the factory in the condition . I know it's only a $100 guitar but if isn't playable then the discount price doesn't matter . It would taken just a few minutes to run the thing back over to the fretting department and have them fix the bad fret instead of just sending it . Now I'm returning it and Amazon will send it back them . I hope that they fix it before selling it to someone else .\n",

I would recommend exercising caution when buying a S34C . The first Ratt distortion pedal I bought in the 80s lasted to 2006.

Cheap disposable junk. cable shorted out after 1 month of light use While it does the job, it also muffles the vocals too much and is not effective for either a stage performance or recording.  A thinner layer of foam would have worked better. Man these cables are crap... I bought 2 and they both stopped working, now I have to move the hell out of the cable to get sound at some point of the cable, I ended up buying other brand. DON'T BUY Get a Comfort Strapp instead.  You get what you pay for. Terrible Product. When I tap or lay my hands on the srrings near the PUs, it'll fall silent. Sorta acts like a Noise clamp of sorts. Has to be faulty in my opinion.  I've always gone monster cables & I'll be going back. They have never let me down. This one? First try, First letdown. Same with Mogami. leave all that $$ stuff alone & go with monster. the plugs are a bit wide and too short to maintain a  solid \"locked\" connection, especially if you use two or more in adjacent jacks. I'd steer clear of these. They sit on a shelf now... too late to return. The right angle side pops out of the jack on a guitar or amplifier, making it unusable. Tested several cables in several jacks. These are defective by nature. bought 2, 1 didn't even last a week before brteaking I bought this to replace a cord I was using to practice my guitar. My first cheap cord wasn't actually broken, but I didn't want any down time, so I had this just sitting there as a replacement. Fast forward some time, and I just wanted to try it out. Even though my cheap cord was still working fine, I really wanted to just try out the new cord.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really wish I had done that in the first 30 days. This cord did not work right at all. It seems like there is a short in it somewhere. I had to unplug/plug/ maneuver into place. Of course since it is for guitar, it falls almost immediately out of place again. So, I am back to the cheap cord that hasn't failed, unlike this brand new bad cable. Very disappointed in these strings. Round wound, very twangy. Had bass at luthier and he recommended them, but he said he was disappointed in this set. They look like they are wrapped with bronze, not nickel. Now I know why they were so cheap. There are issues with these cables or at least the batch that I bought to do 3 pedal boards. I spent over 200 dollars. The tip of the plug was made out of spec \"to big (FAT)\" and will not work in all pedals, meaning, they will not click and lock in the pedals. boss,MXR, MJM pedals to say a few they won't connect with. I've sent them to Planet Waves with the issue with the cables and I'm still waiting to see what they're going to do. There is some danger to some pedals depending on the input parts used. I'll keep you informed on what planet waves does to fix the problem. They are guarantee for life and btw they're made in china. The warrantee is in very small print and you need a magnifying glass to read it but its there. It is very good low capacitance cable like George L but the plugs like I said are out of spec. We'll see what happens. Again, The tip or ball end of the plug was made over sized and is out of spec. first the strings fell apart(the inside wire came out of the wrapping) and caused me to put a large scratch right on the body of the guitar, then the E string snapped on me. im disappointed Stick with Ernie Ball. There's a reason this is less than forty dollars. The unit I received may very well have been defective, but I didn't want to take my chances on another cheap pedal. Might as well just buy a pedal from the people who know how to make pedals (Boss) and be done with it. This unit picked up radio interference, and quite easily overloaded the signal. Not sure if that's the right way to explain it, but with too much distortion or level, it would just cut out, like it was too much. Tried on multiple amps and cables to rule out -- it was the pedal. Even with the levels on very low, it lacked any sort of body like a guitar should have. Not worth it, back it goes. Boring effect. Does not track well and is fizzy and cheap. Unless you want LoFi or NoFi you do not need this. A big mistake;  I wiped my guitar clean of this glorified Vaseline in a micro-dispenser.  LIve and learn.  Heed this. no This pedal has huge issues... it kills your tone and your overall signal power, it's garbage!!! I'm very surprised that Ernie Ball (music gear \"Professionals\") makes this horrible soung pedal, seriously DON'T BUY THIS PEDAL!!!!\n",

Headset hinges broke within month poor build do not buy this pack if you're expecting a 3 sets of strings. what arrived was a single set (6 strings). unfortunately I was in a position where i needed them right away and had to go ahead and slap them on the guitar.

It was not as described in the website. I used it for one day and the strings were already corroded. Don't buy it if you are looking for a corrosion resistant set. D'Addario XL and the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad strings! I've played guitar for over 20 years and have used all kinds of electric guitar strings. I thought I'd buy these \"cheap\" strings for practice, and use a higher end (NYXL) for gigs. Whoa, big mistake. Do yourself a favor and skip this low end product altogether. There's a reason they're cheap, and I'm thoroughly convinced now it's because they're made of the cheapest material known to mankind. After about an hour's worth of use, these things are absolutely toneless. These XL strings, after an hour of playing, sound worse than my NYXL strings that are 2 weeks old with more than 24 hours of bending, slashing, and strumming. Straight up, the XL is garbage. Period. I've played EXL110 for years and loved them, using hundreds of sets, but I think something most have changed with the production.  I've had three high E strings come unwound at the ball end in the past month.  All three were on gigs and now I'm stressed a set won't even make it through a whole show.  Come on D'Addario. I needed to replace poorly built, wobbly and ugly green Wilkinson tuners on my Vintage V100PGM ICON Lemon Drop Greeny guitar.\n",

      "These tuners require 10mm holes in the headstock. Mine had 9mm holes. The description on Amazon didn't say that. Also, the color on these tuners are dull green and not cream like in the picture. I returned them to Amazon. The absolute WORST strings Ive ever put on... JUST JUNK... Cold sticky steel feel... This probably puts DAadario on my - IT'S OVER LIST.. They've steadily been going down hill.... They changed suppliers.... there new strings pretty much suck badly....  DO NOT BUY THESE... I've used these strings for the past 2 years and they usually last for ever. I purchased 4 sets from Amazon a couple of months ago and they are faulty, the 2W snapped on 3 of the sets when fitting, not good. I'll stick to Guitar Center in the future! Awesome strings, watch were you buy them from! When you ask people 'what are the best strings' they will always tell you to try different strings and decide for yourself. This is the first set I've tried that I'll be switching out immediately.  I played the extra lights when I first started learning and I know they are not the best sounds but I wanted to give my fingers a break since I have not been playing as much around the holidays but when someone in the house commented my guitar did not sound 'right' I knew it was even worse than I thought.  The color coding on these is also weird but that's minor since I know what size strings should go where.  I bought 3 sets in different weights so I'll try them all but I'll stick to the Martin x-lites in the future. They changed the length of the string by shortening them by a fraction of an inch and they barely fit on my nut. This last set actually routed out a groove out of my nut causing my string to buzz terribly while playing. I had to buy a new nut and change the scale of my strings after 6 years of no problems. and 3 different basses. sound sucks Seems to humidify fine, but the design could be better. I followed instructions carefully and it still scuffed up my guitar around the sound hole. Would not recommend. DO NOT USE ON A QUALITY INSTRUMENT - you'll be sorry like I am. Strings 5 and 6 (b and high e) broke as I was putting them on, not as good as the EXL 140s. unfortunately cant afford to buy a new pack to restring my PXD void 1. Bought these because they were $5 at a local retailer, compared to the other nylon sets running $12-17. Thought I would see if I could tell the difference and did not expect to.\n",

      "These do stay in tune, but that's about all I can say for them. I bought them to replace a dead set of strings, but these sounded even deader right out of the package. I played these strings for like three months and still don't sound like Stevie Ray Vaughan.  I've also been watching all his old interviews on YouTube and not once does he admit to the fact that he would have been nothing without this particular gauge of strings.  Nor does he cop to the fact that he used a plain 20 for the G string.  I am not impressed.  I will never play 13s again until I hear an official apology from his estate.  Music used to mean something, man. I put this on a guitar I have owned for 40 years. I am ready to take them off as they fail to hold their tune.  Even after continuous tuning for a month they are out after  5 minutes. Dont bother with these. After around 10 years of using these, I am finally switching to a different brand. The last 4 3set packs I have purchased came with at least 1 string deffective. Waste of time and money. Sometimes you can tell the string is deffective right away, but other times it takes a few strummings. This last one started to de-tune by itself brand new. not happy ... I bought a set of classical (nylon) guitar strings a couple of months ago. They were labeled as \"student\" strings. I received them promptly, and they were so good that I ordered another set over a month ago, but they never arrived. So, I can't rate them. But the service actually gets no stars. They kept my money! (1 cent!) I bought these in my ongoing search for a good coated string that would both sound good and last. I thought that these, being black, and my Strat being dark grey and black from headstock to strap button, would also look good on my guitar.\n",

      "Well, one out of three. They do look good. But they don't sound good. Actually I don't know if they'll last, because I'm getting them off the guitar.\n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose of a coated string is longer lasting good tone. Not longer lasting metal. So if a coated string starts out sounding dull and, frankly, like a worn out uncoated string, who cares if in some other sensecorrosion resistance, e.g.it lasts longer than an uncoated string? These sounded worn out when I strung them up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound of these strings is utterly lacking in highs--in fact, as I was playing some bass riff on them, I suddenly understood--they sound like a guitar bass string. They have no highs at all. That nice new string sparkle is totally absent, and riffs played on the bass strings sound more like one of those old Fender six-string guitar basses.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the plain strings, G, B, and E, feel terrible. They look great--but it's like playing painted strings. (That may be literally what they are.) They feel tacky (as in grippy, not in bad taste) and bumpy--not slick and smooth like an unwound string should. I was very disappointed in this harmonica. It came in damaged and the company was not helpful at all. I've used several strings before, D'Addario, Martin, Ernie Ball, Elixer, GHS, etc. And these are by FAR my LEAST favorite, I despise them, they look cool but aside from they they're awful, out of the box they are as dead as a door nail, ignore the novelty of coated strings and just by some Elixir or Ernie Ball, they're much better strings than this garbage, absolutely terrible. Counterfeit!!!  Internal packages clearly state \"Made in USA\", overwrap has \"Made in China\" barcode sticker, and D'Addario states string code has already been registered.  Reported to D'Addario and Amazon! Questionable quality at best... or just plain junk. These are the worst I have seen in fifty years of playing. The top E was coming apart as I was putting it on, and the bottom E never got above Db before popping. It is a shame, they use to be good strings.\n",

      "I just checked the D'Addario web site to make sure the strings were not counterfeit... turns out they are real... just not very good. I bought these strings to use for my 6 string to tune to drop B ..what I got was no 54 gauge string and 2 extra light strings !!! So I was disappointed ..won't buy again Counterfeit! purchased through 8th street music-lower case. Got these for my kids guitar thinking they'd be easy on his fingers.  They're too thin.  They barely register on the pickups, presumably no enough mass to get a good response.  They also go sharp way too easy if you play chords.  Switched to 9's.  These are horrible. 2 strings broke while stretching them and can't get hold of D'Addario on their website!!! A little upset!!!!!!;;!; Amazing at first but after not playing for 3 weeks in my case they got rusted really bad...might go back to elixirs or other strings that won't rust as fast.

And i just received one set of strings. I mean ... apparently you made a mistake. you sent me a package of one set of strings, when in fact buy the set of 10.

Broke the D string within a week.  I replaced all the strings again.  Broke the D string within one day in the middle of a gig.  Very frustrating.  I'm going to switch brands.

I know about expansion and contraction and take good care of my little GS171 YAMAHA flamenco,(well kept humidity level room and away from sunlight too) I have been disappointed with these strings, They must have a very short shelf life compared to other brands. Over a period of three years using at least three three set boxes.. I experienced that every replacement set , one of the low silverplated strings will break /pop/snap on the guitar on it's own just sitting on the stand. I own many acoustics and electrics and playing  for decades, no set a strings break this fast.  I would not recommend these after having this problem for at least six sets of three packed strings over the past few years. ok i don't know if i just got a dud but, i went through 3 high e strings in 3 days. the first one snapped before it could get to e, the second one snapped while loosening the string (seriously!?). and the third one just snapped while sitting in high e. nunca llegaron a mis manos poured a whole bottle in fogger, barely could smell vanilla The one I received has a PLASTIC adjustment collar, NOT die-cast or anything resembling metal . . . . so of course it strips out easily and will no longer hold height adjustments.\n",

I've used several different strings in my lifetime, from GHS Boomers to Fender Bullets, to my only true love, Ernie Ball Super Slinky's, and I have to say these are the absolute worst strings I've ever played... here is why... They NEVER stay in tune on any guitar I own (and I've tried themon several, from ESPs to Gibsons, to USA Fenders). I am CONSTANTLY tuning these POS strings. One chord after tuning and the whole guitar needs to be re-tuned. Next, they stay bright for about 2 hours. These are some of the deadest feeling/sounding strings I have ever played. I know a lot of people will disagree with me, and I really do not know why so many people love these so much. I thikn it's because they are cheap and marketed well. Sadly, like I said... to me, worst string ever made. Makes sense I was buying these 10 packs for like $16. I decided to get this because I have 14 guitars and buying strings can get expensive. Plus these are the strings I prefer anyways. Had high hopes for it but even looking at the picture I thought \"I wonder how they get the strings to not bind up inside?\". The answer? They didn't. First string I went to grab was the low E. I followed the instructions and held the rest of the strings in place while pulling and it got stuck. Pulled as hard as I could without risking damage to the string and it would only come out about 6 inches...and then it wouldn't go back in. I tried another string, same thing. I now had 2 low E strings sticking out 6 inches from the box. I had no choice but to open the box up all the way, take apart the plastic spools inside, unwind ALL of the low E strings, and then try to wrap them back up again. The result? I now have 25 brand new low E strings with finger prints all over them. Thought my problems were over once I finished with the 3 wound strings. Nope. Sure enough went to grab a G and it got stuck. Took some serious coaxing to get it out. I would rather pay the extra money for 25 individual sets of these strings than ever get this bulk box again. They didn't even wrap each bundle of strings in protective sleeves either so by the time I use the last few sets they will probably be corroded and useless. Especially the low E's thanks to my prints. Basically what I'm saying is unless you are a guitar repair tech and plan on changing 25 sets of strings in one week do NOT buy this. Waste of money. I thought something was drastically wrong with my guitar but it was these strings, they buzzed and move so much they hit every metal on every fret. do not buy this pack if you're expecting a 3 sets of strings. what arrived was a single set (6 strings). unfortunately I was in a position where i needed them right away and had to go ahead and slap them on the guitar. I bought a set of 3 regular light gauge (.10) strings.  When I went to install the low E string, it must have been defective, because there was hardly any tension on the string I was winding when it broke just before the saddle.  I have included a picture of the break as a customer picture.  I was able to replace it with the low E string from the next set, however I'm still out a set of strings.  It isn't worth the hassle to return the pack, so I'm keeping them, but this'll probably be the last time I purchase from this brand. It was not as described in the website. I used it for one day and the strings were already corroded. Don't buy it if you are looking for a corrosion resistant set. D'Addario XL and the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad strings! I've played guitar for over 20 years and have used all kinds of electric guitar strings. I thought I'd buy these \"cheap\" strings for practice, and use a higher end (NYXL) for gigs. Whoa, big mistake. Do yourself a favor and skip this low end product altogether. There's a reason they're cheap, and I'm thoroughly convinced now it's because they're made of the cheapest material known to mankind. After about an hour's worth of use, these things are absolutely toneless. These XL strings, after an hour of playing, sound worse than my NYXL strings that are 2 weeks old with more than 24 hours of bending, slashing, and strumming. Straight up, the XL is garbage. Period. I've played EXL110 for years and loved them, using hundreds of sets, but I think something most have changed with the production.  I've had three high E strings come unwound at the ball end in the past month.  All three were on gigs and now I'm stressed a set won't even make it through a whole show.  Come on D'Addario.

I played these strings for like three months and still don't sound like Stevie Ray Vaughan.  I've also been watching all his old interviews on YouTube and not once does he admit to the fact that he would have been nothing without this particular gauge of strings.  Nor does he cop to the fact that he used a plain 20 for the G string.  I am not impressed.  I will never play 13s again until I hear an official apology from his estate.  Music used to mean something, man. After around 10 years of using these, I am finally switching to a different brand. The last 4 3set packs I have purchased came with at least 1 string deffective. Waste of time and money. Sometimes you can tell the string is deffective right away, but other times it takes a few strummings. This last one started to de-tune by itself brand new. not happy ... I play a Taylor 614ce and I decided to try these out and I was majorly disappointed.  They sounded very harsh in the attack, they felt sticky to the touch, and the balance was way off.  After a few hours the tone was already dying and the 4th and 3rd strings sounded like old nylon strings.  I remember why I stopped using these several years ago.  They sound as cheap as they cost. I bought these strings to use for my 6 string to tune to drop B ..what I got was no 54 gauge string and 2 extra light strings !!! So I was disappointed ..won't buy again I bought this from guitar center. I'm glad they come in three packs because I popped #1 #3 and #6 all at the  same time I was replacing my old strings. I use to buy this brand. I wonder what had happened to quality. My Taylor deserves a lot better. Got these for my kids guitar thinking they'd be easy on his fingers.  They're too thin.  They barely register on the pickups, presumably no enough mass to get a good response.  They also go sharp way too easy if you play chords.  Switched to 9's.  These are horrible. 2 strings broke while stretching them and can't get hold of D'Addario on their website!!! A little upset!!!!!!;;!; Amazing at first but after not playing for 3 weeks in my case they got rusted really bad...might go back to elixirs or other strings that won't rust as fast. The small e-string and the g- string both broke on the ball end while tuning.  I haven't broke a string while tuning in 20 years, never ever had one break on the ball end.\n",

      "But I can't recommend this product. Hi! I clearly remember buying a set of 10 normal light strings D'Addario (10-46). And i just received one set of strings. I mean ... apparently you made a mistake. you sent me a package of one set of strings, when in fact buy the set of 10. I really need to solve my problem because i want to keep my instrument working. I hope you can help me to give my opinion on the matter.\n",

I don't intend to return the whole package because I'm not living in the US now. but I definitely won't buy another. ok i don't know if i just got a dud but, i went through 3 high e strings in 3 days. the first one snapped before it could get to e, the second one snapped while loosening the string (seriously!?). and the third one just snapped while sitting in high e. This is nightmare! I wish I can put zero stars for this product- they sound very unpleasant below 5th fret and is squeaking like hell when move your fingers.

Not good I have a Stradivarius model 37. This is the poorest Val protector I have ever owned and I have been playing over 40 years. It fits loosely, it is very thin  and  the Velcro is not positioned correctly. I wish I would've never bought this. I suggest you pass on this one too. I'm going to try somewhere else to get a decent valve protector. Alright Ive used this guitar for about 3-4 weeks its extremely uncomfortable to play when sitting down so this would only be comfortable to play while standing up with a strap on bottom line is the guitar looks \"cool\" at first but at this price a lot of kids will be buying this guitar thus making the unique look it has not so unique so if you buying this for the looks save your money its uncomfortable as hell to play while sitting down This board is a total waste of money. It buzzes terribly, which is why I sent it back. The board itself is made of cheap fuzz and is very oddly shaped. The bag is not too bad though, but offers no protection. I ended up getting a great board used off ebay and I saved a huge amount for a waaaaay better product. The velcro surface is very cheap, the riser broke within a week of light use (the screws stripped), the power supply wouldn't work with any of my Boss pedals due to excessive humming so I still had to power them with batteries.  You might as well save your money and spend it on a better product. Connection doesnt fit neck of Alveraz acoustic guitar After less than 20 hours of gentle use, the plastic bar that attaches the strap broke - causing my bass to fall and break a tuning peg.  No abuse or aggressive play.  Cheap plastic and poor mechanical design appears to be at fault. I don't like writing bad reviews, but this one is necessary. I've been a performing musician for 40 years and never had a product fail like this one did. I loved it at first, locks on perfectly without any hassle. Last night I was playing a wedding, with a fairly lightweight bass too, and the plastic just snapped right off from the piece that's connected to the strap. The part over the strap peg stayed on the bass, that whole contraption though just broke in half. Impossible to fix. If I didn't have another strap I'd have been in trouble for the rest of the evening. Strap is only a couple of months old, and I only used it about 5 times (my other basses have straplocks on them). Irony of this whole thing is that the whole point of this strap is so that your instrument won't fall off. With this, it will fall off - and you won't even be able to put it back on again. Yes, I may have gotten one that was defective, but I don't think so. Looked fine. Plastic just snapped right in half.\n",
      "\n",
      "[edit] After reading some of the other reviews, I want to add that there is a chance what another reviewer is true. Perhaps this isn't a legit Planet Waves product, but a fake from this particular seller. I always believed them to have a solid reputation, but the strap I had was a cheap piece of garbage. The quality of the product is actually very good, I'm giving a one star review because I ordered the strap in red and received a brown one. The price of the item didn't justify a return so I'm stuck with the brown strap. Okay, the idea is good, but the materials used are inferior. What good is a locking mechanism if the cheap plastic breaks off? The plastic part that the nylon strap is looped through broke clean off, right on stage. Luckily it was right at the end of a song as I played the last chord, and I held onto the guitar so it didn't go crashing down on the stage. But it could have, I was just lucky. Where the strap loops onto the plastic mechanism is the weak link. The locking part is a good idea. Not going to trust this thing with my instruments though. I had an old Ernie Ball spare strap in my case with simple leather ends. I will use it from now on. I probably didn't realize what I was purchasing.  The quick release is HUGE - it is 2 inches wide and 4 inches long!.  Also the nylon strap feels cheap.  I have a Levy's cotton strap that is much more comfortable. Doesn't fit my les paul and is super shirt in length This strap's mechanism is so large it can't work on the neck of either of my acoustics (Dean or the Taylor).  I can't see it working on any acoustic neck button.  Additionally, the Taylor's jack just barely fits into the hole, but cannot be locked down.  This was a total fail on acoustic guitars. sized for a child Bought one of these at Guitar Center and loved it. Ordered two from this Amazon merchant and got two guitar straps that smell like I they have been soaked in diesel and petroleum. I guess they came right off the boat from Malaysia or Indonesia. I tried washing them and the oil substance floated on top of the water. If you use one of them your clothes end up smelling very bad. Based upon some of the other reviews, I feel I got a different product, as it didn't fit the descriptions given by others. I ordered two of these, and both were very thin material, not sturdy at all. Second, both straps were not adjustable to 59\". Both mine measured 45\" from strap button hole to strap button hole, fully-extended. They are useless to me, as my guitar, a dreadnought, covers the middle of my chest when I put it on. I believe I was given a substitute product, since when I ordered these straps, the price was just $1.00, and now they're back up to $4.95 as I write this. I'm really sick of these Amazon substitutions. For what I paid, I won't bother returning them...not worth the hassle. I will donate them to a local music teacher who has students with smaller guitars. Very disappointed. Warning...if you see a price drop below $4.95, don't buy...it's probably not the product that's described here. You get what you pay for. I don't play heavy metal, I play alt rock. I used this for about 2 weeks, one day a week, and it has already fallen apart. The items front plastic peeling has come off. Also, it has already lost its stick. Would not refer this product to anyone. I clicked on a strap with the locking ends.  When I changed the color aparently it changed it to a strap without the locking ends.  Bad glitch with the system, the strap is fine for a non locking strap but that's not what I ordered. Unlike all the reviews I'm seeing and the picture of the item itself, my strap did not come with any kind of locks on it.  It's just a regular red strap with leather (or fake leather) ends to stick the strap pins into.  There's no locking mechanism to speak of.  I don't know if I was just sent the wrong item or what, but it's a Planet Waves strap, looks otherwise identical to the picture above. This model seemed a good idea. Being made of rubber, I thought it would fit well different bridges. The problem here is this particular one stinks so much, of chemicals, that it's impossible to be in the same room. I'm not exaggerating. After a few minutes the smell is all over the place. The seller suggested to rub it with baking soda, and leave it outside the house for a day or so. It didn't really do anything. I threw it away. Look, these products do a good job of cleaning your horn, they don't leave fiber or anything inside your horn, but the reason I say avoid these products at all cost comes with the storage of these types of devices. Unless you have an extra space to store a pad saver, a bell brush, and a neck saver don't bother getting them, otherwise they leave all that moisture you were supposed to take out of your horn and ruins your pads an encourages the growth of mold. Avoid these and get a simple silk swab with a weight attached to a string. It gets the moisture OUT. Firstly, you need to know that this ships from China.  There's nothing wrong with that, except that it will take 2-3 weeks to arrive, so don't hold your breath...\n",

      "...until it does.  Because this thing stinks.  Literally.  It smells like it was carved of rubber from the sole of your local gas station attendant's shoe.  I should have read the other reviews before buying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason to pay attention to reviews would have been to avoid the black smudge that this POS left on the violin bridge.  Cheap rubber.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to its effectiveness, it reduced the volume of the violin from an 11 to about an 8.  Not as much as expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not a complainer, and I leave plenty of good reviews for worthy products.  This isn't one.  This thing is cheap in every respect of the word.  It's bad for your violin, probably bad for your health, and a waste of $5.99. I suppose it would have worked okay if I'd tried it. But when it arrived and I took it out of its plastic sleeve it stank so bad, it almost made my eyes water. The petroleum smell literally filled the practice room. I didn't get far enough to trying it out. I threw it away. It took almost two days for the smell to dissipate. I guess I'll have to stick with my non-odiferous metal mute. It did not do all that much to quite the violin. I really wanted this to work, but it doesn't.  Don't bother,it doesn't mute the strings at all.  One star, just for it getting here on time. The threads do not fit any of my cymbal stands which basically makes this product useless.. sorry I bought a Glaesel Bridge & this Glaesel rubber mute together. I bought this because it was cheap and had so many good reviews. The mute fits the bridge fine, but compared to a brass mute (which of course works VERY well) this mute seems to do absolutely nothing. There is almost no discernible difference in playing the violin with or without this mute on. Also, the mute can affect your playing so certain notes screech or stutter or produce other undesirable noises.\n",

      "I consider this mute completely useless since it does not do anything at all. It does *not* mute or lower the volume of any violin in any noticeable way. My daughter has a 3/4 Glaesel Violin that is 16 years old (a gift from her cousin).  Last November we had to replace the bridge with a different brand because the local store only had a 4/4 Glaesal bridge and she had a school concert coming up.  The Mute fits just fine, but we tired and tried and could not get the the mute to work.  At best there was about a 5% reduction in volume. I doubt the fact that the replacement bridge being a different brand made any difference. This thing broke within 3 weeks. I play metalcore and it couldn't keep up. Go with Sabian instead. They are way more durable then these things. A friend of mine gave me a pair of these cymbals because he was cleaning out his house.  The sound is so bad on these things it is embarrassing.  They are definitely an entry level cymbal but they sound like two garbage can lids being smashed together.  I have played with Zildjain hi-hats my whole life and love them but you need to be willing to spend more to get a good sound.  Don't waste your money. junk..you get what you pay for, these are the bottom end, save your money..a-customs, k line..then youll have some quality cymbals.. these aren't even good enough for beginners,,waste of money Sounds tinny, going back to my 10 in splash. The ZBT cymbal I bought sounds cheap..I wouldn't bother with these..not what you would expect from Zildjian. Stay away. These trash can lids should stay only in the confines of your basement, should you buy them. If you do any live shows or recordings, STAY AWAY!!! They sound trashy and bend under heavy use. More like a trashcan lid. less like a quality product. I've used Zildjian since September 1998 and I decided to replace some broken and absent pieces from the kit. This was a mistake. The worst cymbals made. They sound like trashcan lids and bend as soon as you strike them. I'm very disappointed in Zildjian For even making them! i went through 2 in about 5 months but the 18 inch crash ride wen used as a ride cymbal has lasted me about a year and a half with only 1 small crack that hasn't grew and my hi-hats still sound that same way as when i took them out of the box same with m 16 inch zbt crash.....the only cymbal from the zbt line i hate is the 14\" if u want a good cymbal for a cheap price buy the 16\" the 14 \" failed miserably Bars are square and thin. Nothing like the round ones I am used to using... I don't even use it now. broke after 5 mins... Junk go american Dj light bridge!! Spend that extra money!!! really cheap plastic, cracked under the hinge just sitting there.  I don't understand why Hohner would put their name on this. I did not care for the sound of this Tamborine at all. The sound was way too much \"head\" compared to the amount of jangle produced by the metal parts. The tone of the head was also odd to my ears, maybe I just got a bad one but it was not a sound we could use in our recording studio. This had to go back. ok The uke i received had a crack in the base and was a pretty terrible glue job. It doesn't stay in tune at all. Not much to say about this one. Try another brand if mine is any indication. I was astonished at the poor quality of this item.  Immediately upon unwrapping the package I noticed that it has that 1980s \"RONCO\" appearance, complete with faded and stained box, out of date photo, and emblazoned with \"As seen on TV\".  Inside the package was a \"songbook\" which appeared to have been typed on an actual typewriter and copied on an antique Xerox machine showing which chords to strum while singing the titles, many of which were popular during the Civil War in the vein of \"Hand Me Down My Walking Cane\", \"Ain't Gwine to Study War No More\" and similar.  For a device intended for the beginner player the explanation of which paddle presses which fin and the chord it is supposed to produce is more complicated than actually learning to play!  Upon assembly I noticed first that it does not fit \"any\" guitar.  Mine is a standard classical guitar made by Ibanez. The strings are too far apart for the fins on this product to press them correctly.  The product is basically several plastic paddles with vertical fins below each which, when pressed, are intended to depress the guitar strings.  As they are made of hard plastic these fins easily slip right off the strings.  That's if you can manage to press them given that the product is so large that it is harder to get your fingers around it than it is to get into position on the strings themselves and given that the attachment scheme is unreliable and wobbles around on the neck.  Finally,  there are rubber lining strips which are supposed to protect the back of the neck and the face of the strings from the device itself.  These fail to stay attached to the device.  All in all this device has the look and feel of one of those disappointing things we used to buy through ads in the back of comic books (remember those X-Ray glasses?) and then weren't surprised when they arrived and we found they did not live up to the hype.  However, those items were generally priced at 50 cents, not 25.00  I requested a return for refund and the seller offered a refund but did not want the product back. Should have listened to the reviews.. Antiquated design. Serious string buzz AND dead strings... Followed instructions to a T. No better If you buy this, don't say \"hey ladies, i play guitar!\" You don't. You play guitar hero. If you buy this, you will be called a pussy by all who can ACTUALLY PLAY. garbage There is quite literally more plastic in a McDonalds happy meal toy. so Why on EARTH IS THIS $30???????????? Because the company is a greedy company that is trying to leech as much cash from their customers as possible. I thought I'd get this for my 2 year old but he can already bar a chord now so it is useless. do yourself a favor and just learn the friggin' guitar already. It's not that hard. Are you telling me my two year old is cooler than you??? Crapped out after a few usages, and noisy, noisy, noisy.  Bad Behringer.  Bad, bad, Behringer. I bought this pedal for my Behringer US600 pitch shifter in order to control the sweep of the octaving. Delivery was right around the time it was expected, which was nice. The problem most people are going to run into with using this pedal with the pitch shifter is neither the pitch shifter nor this control pedal come with very good instructions on how to hook one up to the other, other than jacking into output 2 on the FCV with the other jack in the ctrl port on the us600 (pitch shifter).\n",
      "\n",
      "They don't specify that you have to use a stereo cord to make it work. Luckily I had one from an old computer sub as well as 2-3/8\" to 1/4\" adapters, THAT got it goin. But as I started using this pedal I noticed a couple other issues: the action in the sweep is VERY heavy on the heel, that is to say the heel on the pedal goes so damn low you could almost sprain your ankle using it. I tried to alleviate that by folding a guitar strap several times, wrapping it with duct tape, and velcroing it to the heel of the pedal to make the heel higher, the only issue with that is now the forward motion on the pedal is still very crazy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also ITS HUGE!!! This pedal is so much bigger than I expected that I thought it was something else entirely when I first got it; needless to say I made room on my pedal board for no reason, so it sits next to my pedal board.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're going to do the strap thing I described, take the rubber boot off of the FCV first. The adhesive on the velcro will not grip the rubber and I was using heavy duty velcro from home cheapo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also you will need to invest in a 12 volt power supply as apposed to just trying to jack into your daisy chain... Yes, this pedal is VERY friggin' special like that. I got a universal power supply for around $15 here on amazon and it works just fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line: This pedal ain't worth the time, effort or money required to use it. Spending the extra $80-$100 on the digitech whammy pedal is the only way to go. Behringer Dropped the ball hard on this one. Initially I was impressed with the construction of this pedal. It seems rather well built for the price.... thats where the positivity ends. I plugged it into my power supply and it didn't work so I switched to a 9 volt. I took the cover off, attached the battery and spent the next five minutes trying to put the cover back on correctly. The battery cover is a prime example of piss poor engineering IMHO. I plugged it into my rig and when I played I could not believe what I heard.... utter CRAP! Tinny, shrill, thin and above all NOISE NOISE NOISE! I guess there are some things you cannot go cheap on... I've learned my lesson here! I purchased this as an extra CV controller for a Digitech Control 2. When I got it, I tried it out as a volume pedal just for kicks and YES it does suck the tone right out of the signal. As far as a CV controler? it sucks at that too! Why? it squeaks as you move it (after 5 minutes use, right out of the box). Behringer is a joke and gives German engineering a bad name (although only 'conceived' in Germany).\n",
      "It's a direct copy of the Yamaha FC9 and so I am about to purchase one of those and see how it compares. I'm betting the extra 45 dollars will be well worth it.\n",
      "Also, you may say \"who cares if it squeaks a little\"? well I do when I am controlling volume swells or a 'wah' effect at low volume in the studio!\n",
      "Good luck if you buy it. It holds the guitar up, but the inside of the strap will rub your neck raw....do not recommend Fender monogrammed pattern stitched onto a cheapo beginner strap.  Thin, scratchy, stiff, poly material.  I have a couple of these Fender Monogrammed strats, they have leather backing.  Wanted to get another like them.  I guess they don't make them anymore.  The stock picture shows a leather backing like they are supposed to have.  But the one sent to me was certainly not leather.  Maybe this is a cheap chinese knockoff?  Who knows...\n",

      "Luckily Amazon is awesome and I was able to return it for a full refund. Piece of junk. genuine fender part that was defective. is a dual pot with center detent-- supposed to be 250k/1megk. top pot was correct (1megK) but bottom pot measured out at 2megK. It also did not Taper off but jumped almost immediately to 0K. Rather than return for refund or exchage i decided to just keep the other parts (Cap, Resist, and knob). Note-- the other Fender regular 500k pot was excellent. Have NO problems with the seller-- good to deal with!! The device works fine for reducing treble, covering the full range of a normal tone control in one half turn. But I cannot detect any effect at all when adjusting to cut the low end (the unit's only promised benefit). I watched a youtube video demo of a Strat having this control and also couldn't notice any change when trying to cut the low end. Perhaps this gadget is just a practical joke.\n",

      "Overall, this impulse buy was a total bust. I have vintage fender custom with a authentic fender bridge. It didn't fit because e guess i don't have the VINTAGE FENDER BRIDGE. But i think it bulls*** that the product only fits certain bridges. Even the fact that mines is a vintage model guitar. Just avoid it. Useless. Will not fit my standard MIM Fender Strat. Way too big. This pickguard was used. It not only was missing the protective plastic but it actually was scratched from being on a guitar before. I'm just warning you guys, this thing smells toxic. It has that super cheap plastic strong odor. I tried airing it out in another room and it stunk up my living room. I then put it outside in the garage and it still stinks. I didn't send it back because I still want an amp cover when the amp leaves the house but be warned that if you sleep in the same house as this cover you will have two-headed babies. It also is not very thick but a cheap thin vinyl. I pretty much knew that would be the case before I bought it however. If I had to do it over again, I would buy my own material and then take it to a tailor. I am sure it won't cost much more than twenty bucks for someone to stitch you a square. Bought this a while back just got around to installing it on my mexi strat. Doesn't fit perfect. Kinda bummed but oh well worst mic ever. go with Gls es57. or a differen Pyle pro.... no joke. gave it to my kids as a toy. unable to use for recording. just awful. skip this or you'll be sorry. never worked Does not fit the strata caster pegs Poorly made.  The back plate was thinner and smaller than my factory installed Squier back plate.  Flimsy.  The knobs lettering lacked the detail of my factory knobs.  Im surprised this is a genuine Fender product.  I specifically searched for Fender so I wouldnt get a cheap quality product. just right Unless you guys are receiving something I am not, how can you give this anything more than one star. My backplate is so thin and cut so close to the screws that you can actually see were the route begins on the back of my Fender stratocaster. This is inexcusable. All the other Fender backplates I have have enough lip to cover the route, but not this mint green one. I simply cannot understand what Fender is thinking.  I am seeing nothing but product after product like this coming from Fender and it is a clear sign they are simply trying to maximize profits at any cost. My problem I guess would be more with fender as a company. I bought this kit to put on a Fender Starcaster I just purchased and besides the knobs and trem cap nothing else even comes close to fitting. The poles on the pickups are much closer together than the holes in the covers, the toggle switch is cut much wider than the switch it came with so it falls right off, and the back plate is way smaller than the one that comes with the guitar. I just think it's really stupid the company makes an entry level strat that cannot be upgraded with simple parts. Guess that's what happens when you buy an outsourced guitar. From the sound of a few other reviews these also do not fit Squier guitars either. Even if everything did fit the parts just look like something you would get out of a cheap model car kit. You can see the notch where each part was cut from the mold. Not trying to be overly critical but I've seen higher quality molded plastic on mcdonalds toys. Guess the rest of this kit will just get thrown in the spare parts bin. Shame. Need 2 volume knobs and 1 tone, so for the price (and in the past) I have always purchased 2 packs together with no issues, however recently I needed and ordered some and I found out of 4 sets, no consistency in quality... example the lettering is thinner on some than others within the same set and between sets of the same item#. Also some had bright white lettering and others did not (but where not vintage lettering either). Guess these are too cheap for Fender to have QC on.\n",

      "Will try other brands next time. Well, this is my 2nd Behringer product. The first is the HellBabe01 wah wah pedal. Very good...especially for the price. So, that convinced me to try out the GM108 amp.\n",
      "\n",
      "I received it yesterday and I have to admit...I really like it. Has very good sound although you have to set it just right. The distortion is not the best, and it can overwhelm you. The amp modeling is not bad, although there seems to be very little difference between the U.K. and U.S. settings. I've read where people complain the clean setting is too quiet. Hmmm...mine seems to be fine. It's not super loud, but not soft, either.\n",

      "Trust me, try one of there other (bigger) amps or another brand. This is a very low entry level mando that someone decided needed a pickup.  The ONLY thing holding pickup in the mandolin are the two screws which retain the pickup to the pick guard.  The pick guard is then secured, sort of, to the mandolin with four screws.  Nothing secures the pickup to the mandolin, directly.  Consequense: the pickup is free to vibrate, rattle and shake around on the flexible pick guard.  How can that be a good thing?\n",
      "\n",
      "There is NO truss rod in the neck of this mandolin.  While that might be acceptible on an eighty dollar mando, it's a crime in this price range.  Any natural wood neck is going to warp, eventually.  Neck warpage is a matter of fact caused by string tension and humidity.  When this neck warps, it will require a major overhaul to correct on this instrument.  The repair would likely cost more than the purchase price of this thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tuning machines are junk.  The \"knobs\" on the tuners are glued-on plastic, meaning, there are no screw securing the knobs to the posts.  My mandolin arrived with a tuner knob broken completely off.  (The nice thing is, I was able to replace the entire set of tuners with identical parts for a retail price of $12).\n",
      "\n",
      "The pickup is a single coil \"lipstick\" unit that, actually, doesn't sound too bad once you find an acceptible level of volume and tone.  The pots are terribly noisy to adjust when plugged in and powered up.  This is the sort of symptom I would expect from a 20-year-old piece of electrical equipment- usuall caused by an accumulation of dust and dirt.  I am more than a little disappointed that it presents such noise in this new mando.\n",
      "\n",
      "All said and done, anyone looking at this mando should either spend a few hundred dollars more for something of greater quality or spend a couple hundred dollars less for a \"nameless\" mando of equal quality.  It's a shame that Fender has lowered itself to the point of putting its name on this junk.  I think Epiphone probably has the good sense not to follow suit. I ordered this mic based on all the reviews that said it was equilivant to the SM58.  When I connected it to my PA amp all I got was popping noises and handeling noise.  No voice at all.  On top of that, the included clips mounting threads are too small for my On Stage mic stand.  Am returning it and will buy a real Shure mic to replace it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update I have since purchased the Samson Q7.  Much better mic.  This one really is as good as the SM58. I was so excited. It came super fast but it didn't fit my stray :( Showing the original list price as $68 is terribly misleading. That has to be the price of a multi-pack of cranks. The crank is worth what I paid for it but it's just one crank. These do not work on a 2001 Mexican. They fall right thru the tremelo hole because there is nothing to stop them. This particular cover did NOT fit my Frontman 212R. I got one from MF and it fit perfectly. Maybe some covers are made in countries with different measurements, like with clothing. The shipping was on time. Well, it would be a nice case if the latches worked properly.\n",
      "They don't however, so I'm sending it right back. The latches are crooked, do not engage properly, are difficult to close, and pop open all on their own. I'm not entrusting this case to keep my Tele secure. Fell apart when I installed it. Junk. Do not buy it. Twice I order two -5- way switches from this store , & each time I recieve only one -5- way switch. The other was a -4- way\"packed in a 5 way bag. to have this happen once would be understandable, but twice in two orders is no accident. this company is not reliable. I did not need to open the items to see the differance, the seller can see what there packing & sends the wrong item. Like it says made in taiwan sO who knows whats in it, lead, cadmium all heavy metals and not the good kind they also small not big for a fender pickguard. picture shown on amazon site is gold fender packaging i got the red package so maybe thiers a  differance, hence the 5 star reviews. also the same thing with fender neck screws not chrome but dull nickle garbage made in taiwan the only way i get fender chrome neck screws is when they come with a fender neck plate and those seem to be made in u.s.a. the only solution i can think of is buy from another company like ernie ball or dimarzio made in u.s as far as i know or go to hardware store and find what your looking for. contact fender for the die hards or seller who your buying from.as for these s' are going in the garbage. I can't believe these were actually sent to me. The heads are smaller than normal pickguard screws and the metal is blackened. They come from Taiwan but look like they were subcontracted to China. I am sending them back. There is no way I would use these. Any screw you get from Home Depot would work better and look more attractive. I am seeing nothing but product after product like this coming from Fender and it is a clear sign they are simply trying to maximize profits at any cost. Pretty disappointed in the color. As the review title indicates, what I received is more of a 'black chrome' or dingy stainless color. These are simply not going to work with the MOTS pickguard I purchased them for. Perhaps they would blend in better on a black, black pearl or tort pickguard.\n",

      "I ordered another package from another vendor and got the same result. Perhaps it is a large factory shipment that is 'bad'. Some are very dull looking. Very disappointing, really. DO NOT BUY! this item is seriously cheap as heck. not worth buying it at all. I didn't even get to use it and it was already losing all of its gems. I wish I got my money back on this item!! Very cheap broke the first time we put it on :( It was pretty but very cheaply made!! Too bad as it is cute The bow fell off multiple times I had to keep gluing it back on until it wouldn't let me glue anymore. of course studs fell off but the bow it what makes it. I was very excited when I first got this case. I loved the color and the feel of it. Then I started noticing stuff on my hands and realized the \"rubber\" peels right off the phone just from normal use. As the saying goes you get what you pay for. Sent case that didn't fit This case for some reason is peeling, there isn't much left of the orginal skin, i  loved the case with pink being my favorite color but i wouldn't recommend this specific one for anyone. phone case does not work. the clips may be broken, it does not work. the case is a little scratch and missing paint. it fits my phone but does not stay clipped! I would not recommend getting this charger. I can literally have my phone (samsung galaxy 2) charging for over 6 hours and it will not be fully charged. This is the only charger I have ever bought that sucks like this. Do not buy You are saying that you sell a Universal charger but what you sold me was a blasted Blackberry charger! I am so mad right now!! I can't believe this. I was so excited waiting for a charger for my samsung battery charger and all I got was a BLACKBERRY CHARGER. DON'T EVER BUY FROM THIS SELLER. The charger only lasted a week ad after that it just stopped charging my Samsung Galaxy S3.  They really need to start making these chargers better....I've been thru several!!!! Did not last that long I did not use it for a few months then when I used it it did not work at all. This charger from Amazon lasted about two months, I replaced it with one I bought direct from Samsung, thus the Samsung from Samsung the real McCoy, from Amazon not sure who actually made it even though it has a Samsung label. Could not power my S2 phone.  The LG charger I was using had no problem but I needed a second charger.  I thought buying an \"Official Samsung\" charger would be the best route to go.\n",

      "With nothing running on my phone except Waze and Audible (my usual combo when driving) the battery icon showed charging on AC, BUT was losing power at the rate of 5% per hour.  On a long trip I was forced to turn the phone completely off for a few hours to get it to charge.  In fairness it could have been a defective unit but I won't be wasting time trying another of this model.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company has been very accommodating in the return.  The return has been smooth and I WOULD buy from them again. It stops working after 3 days and i won't recommend it at all. So look for another charger not this one First, this is kind of cheap-looking, but I did try to buy the cheapest OEM car charger I could for my phone, so that's forgiveable.  The springs on the side don't have much force, though, so this is constantly slipping out of the 12V car port.  The cable is sturdy, but the rubber near the connector is kind of stiff, which makes charging AND operating your phone on the go a bit of a hassle.  It's held up well since I purchased it though.\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE:  Stopped charging after a month. When I first got this it worked good but I noticed that my galaxy was not charging like it was in the first stages of this purchase. It stopped working all together. I'm very disappointed in this product, I would never buy this product again. Very bad.. I received this product in a very timely manner which was delightful, however, I gave it as a gift and was embarrassed to find out it was a defective item. I was reimbursed for the product but would have much rather had a product that worked the first time. After 2 weeks my charger just fell apart while i was taking it from the plug , not a strong charger at all i would have asked for my money but it wasn't even worth it . These don't fit the phone properly.  Total waste of money.  I do not recommend these at all.  Do not buy them. Plugged into the car and worked the first couple of days. Hasn't worked since. My phone does not even recognize it's plugged in. This thing worked well when it actually functioned, but today it stopped working and I am past the 30 day return window by 10 days give or take.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm guessing the quality might not be great as that is why it stopped working, who knows.. What a waste of money. Although it does charge, albeit slower than my original, it does not work to sync it with either my laptop or desktop. My primary purpose for the purchase was to sync the pictures and music from my phone, which the product does not work for. In a nutshell, this is NOT an OEM charger.  Although it has the Samsung markings, it doesn't seat well with a Samsung phone.  This means that it's either meant for another market or it's counterfeit.  With that said, I wouldn't buy this again.\n",

      "The seller tried to make amends by sending me three replacement chargers.  After using this for a while, it is still garbage.  It does not charge my phone and in fact, it drains the phone.  This must be a counterfeit product.  It has Samsung markings but it does not charge the phone.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!! Had all the marking of a legit samsung product but the cord stop working after 3 days. I'm not upset because it was very inexpensive but maybe you should spend a little more and buy a better product off amazon. When it did work it worked very well. This charger doesn't charge the battery of my Samsung Galaxy S2 (i9100) properly.\n",
      "When I connect it to my S2, the screen gets frozen and the cell behaves in a unusual (abnormal) way. I guess I got what I paid for, at $2.49. It (the phone charger) arrived undamaged, but it does not work at all. I tried many different electrical outlets. Still, nothing. I'd give the product NO stars if that were an option. I was deluding myself, thinking that cheaper was just as good. However, a phone charger that's not functioning is worthless. waste of time and money. Light stays on but it is not charging my Samsung Galaxy Note3 this was a complete waste of money. i keep trying to find an OEM car charger that is worth more that junk and have yet to find one. i always buy these knockoff ones and get screwed everytime\n",

      "I have finally lernt my lesson>! Takes forever to recharge the case. Plug it in to charge the case and phone you need to turn it on for the phone to charge. gets very hot while charging the phone which makes it impossibly to carry in your pocket while charging\n",
      "\n",
      ">>> Edit: Had this for less than a week and the case melted. QUE COSA TAN MALAAAAA!!! does not hold charge long. Charged it fully and would only charge phone 40-50% at first and then dropped to 25-35% after that.  Got extremely hot when charging phone.  Not sure if I just got a bad one or this is typical of this brand. Biggest piece of garbage, ever.  Bought two of these - one for my phone and one for my sons.  Neither one worked.  Followed the \"simple\" instructions - plugged phone into case, then plugged charging cord into case.  However, while the case was supposedly charging, the phone was not.  In fact, it appeared that the case was draining power from the phone!  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT.  I will be returning both cases. It's not even enough to charge the HTC One, My phone always display \"Charging Slow\" The battery worked just fine, started draining faster after like 6 months. I Bought this on July 25, 2017 and now March 30 2018, the battery has fattened up, over heated and cause my phone screen to separate from its body. So it basically destroyed my phone and didn't last even a year.\n",

      "Unfortunately, this is not a good buy. This product is soo bad on soo many levels.  Can't even bring my iphone 4s to above 50% from a discharge.  Will let you down when you need it the most and takes way too long to fully charge. Cheap, don't waste your money, fell apart and damaged phone. battery didn't last too long It doesn't last like as a 7800 mah battery should, I have to charge my phone twice a day with light use This setup doesn't last much longer than the thin battery. I was willing to accept this big thick package if I could get a big extended battery life but instead this is lucky if it lasts eight hours. Do not buy.! Worked great, once.  Second time I went to charge my phone it said it couldn't be charged.  Put the factory battery back in and it charges no problem.  Also, battery cover is the thinnest piece of plastic ive ever seen. It cracked in my pocket and I don't even know why. It's the cheapest because it's junk.  Spend $50 on a good one. Case too slippery,  can't hold with one hand\n",

      "Each time I charge it, it lasts shorter time I received, but only the case. Where is the battery ? I buy it for my htc one m7 the first week i was in love whith this charger but at the second week almost burn my phone, it was charging and then I see a spark in the entry of the usb entry and then die. Works when it works, but frequently stops working. Phone will intermittently power off at around 70-80% charge, and requires pulling and reinstalling battery to restart. Manufacturer asked if I had performed calibration (I had) and has since been unresponsive. Repeated calibration, and it worked again. For a while. Phone displays no issues when running OEM battery. Appears to need be be run through calibration on an almost weekly basis; not convenient. Expedite shipping only to receive a defective battery. I put battery in for first time it showed 55 percent tried to charge and it never would charge. I give up I read the comments on this item where so negative with smartphones so I thought give it a try for my tablet since is not to expensive. What a rip of!!!\n",
      "I don't understand with so many bad ratings, why Amazon is still selling it. I lost $10.00 This data cable is not for the palm pre. I've had other non-oem data cable for over a year that works with excellence. Using this data cable not only do not work, but caused the ones I were using with excellence before not to work nor charge my phone now after using this cable as a data cable on my computer.  Now the only DATA CABLE that charges & receive data is the original data cable. All is not lost with my old cables, my wife phone was spared from this destructive cable.  The only thing professional about this cable is that it's destructive.  I done this to my phone as I read other bad reviews about this cable, I wanted to find out for myself & I found out alright the hard way.  Learn from me & others stay away from this product. I would give it a zero if it was possible.  WBJ I purchased 3 of these cables because they were cheap and got good reviews.  I don't know how people are getting these cables to work... but out of the 3 I bought, 0 have functioned properly with my Palm Pre!  The best I can do is get it to charge, though the entire time it is charging the computer is complaining about \"Unknown Device\" and \"Could not install drivers\" even though it works beautifully with the original cable.  The only setting that works is \"Just Charge\"!  Each of the 3 cables fails slightly differently which makes me believe that each has a different flaw!  I've tried this with my Wife's Palm Pixi as well as used different computers and that failed as well.  Look elsewhere when attempting to purchase a cable for your Palm device! This charger did not work well on my phone AT ALL. IT barely charged my phone after four hours of constant charging. I thought it was just my phone so I tried my daughter's phone. ITS STILL A NO GO. \"This cable not recommended for this device.\" That is what I get for an error message. Plus it is really short. I bought this so I could have a longer cable to plug my phone it. When I plug it in, it just says connect charger over and over again. I bought 2 and neither of them work. Don't waste your money.... Broke after 1 week. Very cheap material! Not a good product. This is cheaply made and way to bulky. I bought this for my bluetooth headset case and i regret it. Just crappy plastic. It also has no click control for the turning on your belt so it constantly turns and rotates on it's own. I hope this helps! It has a series of flaky behaviors with the 3650.  It is nominally compatible but in practice very difficult to make work.  The biggest problem is the phone won't ring when the headset is in \"connected\" mode.  It will just vibrate.  If you keep in in \"disconnected\" mode it takes 10-20 seconds to connect so better hope whoever is calling you waits a long time after you pick up (and there is no sound) and it doesn't go to voicemail.  Jabra tech support at first claimed it was a feature - \"thats the way all headsets work\" - yeah right! His suggestion was a) wear the headset all day long (you can hear the ringing thru the headset) b) keep the phone in your pocket all the time so you feel the vibration.  Then when pushed he claimed they are working on fixes.  It irks me that I bought this because [it is] listed ... as compatible, ...\n",
      "The other weakness is that the little eargel falls off very easily in your pocket or if it hits something, so its a pain not to lose it.  Otherwise it is comfortable and the sound quality is pretty decent on speaker and microphone.\n",
      "Look at other headsets ...\n",
      "thanks,\n",
      "Lon I purchased this item recently to use with my Nokia 3650 (an amazing phone, btw). One would think that when Amazon lists the\n",
      "headset as being compatable with the 3650, it might actually work.\n",
      "That's not the case at all, I'm afraid.\n",
      "Apparently, you need to have the cute little blue sticker on the outside of the box for it to work. To their credit, Jabra offered to cross-ship the unit, and Amazon is going to send me a pre-paid return label and will refund my purchase price and shipping.\n",
      "All that's nice, but I'm pretty miffed that I have to mess around with all of this. I don't know who Emerald City Graphics is or why I was apparently purchasing their products, but I don't like it and never I never have! DON'T BUY, IT DOESN'T WORK!!! These things are just a confidence trick. They don't do a thing. They can't do a thing. If you believe these make your phone work better then you probably find the stripes down the side of cars make them go faster too. Waste of MONEY. Does nothing to improve signal. Don't fall for this scam like I did!!!! didn't work for me at all on my IPhone 5 You think that a little piece of shiny plastic will increase your cell phone signal? Well, how about you glue a mineral rock onto the back of your phone? Or maybe wrap it in foil? Seriously, you think that if a 1c solution to the cell signal problem was available, wouldn't your cell carrier give it to you for free? As much as you want it to work, I have bad news for you: it won't. If you have signal issues you need to spend real money, $$$, for a reputable booster like Wilson or zBoost or Uniden (all available at Amazon). So don't get it, because if you do, you will feel really stupid that you fell for it. Waste of money and time I fell for this one when they first came out. All i think it dose is help push the battery away from the antenna and i think the copper  in it was to help block unwanted radio wave interference. I got maybe half a bar but when ther is no signal ther is \"no signal\" al in short. Its a flashy sticker. so far it has not helped my signal strength at all. I still have no signal sucked. Doesn't seem to work. NO GOOD piece of crap did not do anything at all. I am in a low cell phone area and get 1 bar- this didn't even raise it 1 bar-don't waste you money. Nothing don't bay this Do not get this if you have an iPhone. I have a iPhone put this on it and did nothing this is not compatible with iPhone do not get is for your iPhone The antenna for the GS3 according to schematics is at the very lower part of the phone.  Therefore, placing the booster behind the battery does nothing. I've also tried placing it at the bottom of the phone on the removable back with some two sided tape with and the signal is even worse oh well... have tried several phones with these, non responded to a signal difference with them...would not buy again...worthless waste of money for me... Didn't work, It did not work at all. I have a dead spot when I drive to work, where I totally lose the Signal. This device did not help at all. DO NOT WASTE your money on it. even for less than $2.00, its not worth anything. Pretty much useless. I don't really notice any difference in the reception. Waste of money even though it is cheap. didn't do anything for my signal,didn't think it would,save yourself the hassle of waiting for something that does not work Not satisfied with the quality of the product I purchased. Didn't see any difference in reception of the antennae on my cell phone It's one of those things you know in your heart isn't going to work.  However, before I invested in a $100 + to boost the cell signal in my office I was willing to invest the buck and a half just to prove to myself that these things don't work.  Well turns out EVERYTHING you read is true.  They don't do a darn thing.  I have to admit the buck was almost worth it to read the horribly translated English direcions though.  \"Make sure you don't leave gingerprints.\" Dont buy it, it does absolutely nothing.... I know you are tempted to buy it to see if you have a better experience.. but don't do it. This thing is a waste of paper, it doesn't give u any better reception. This is a total rip off in my book :-( we needed a better signal and thought at $2.99 for a 10 pack would be worth a shot. well, they say you get what you pay for and that was certainly true in this case! expect nothing from this product and you won't be disappointed!  really, don't bother.  if you really need a boost for a signal, i recommend checking your other options. don't waste your time or money. I bought this since at work I go in and out of service constantly and I was hoping for something like this to work.  It did nothing sadly, I really wanted it to work.  Also after reading the 5 star reviews I googled them and noticed that those reviews word for word had been used in many places.  They sound real but sadly it's just marketing. The booster antenna Does not work, it actually makes  cell service worse rather than better. Do not buy this product. It doesn't work at all. I rarely write product reviews, but I feel like I should warn others about purchasing and using this product.  I have had success using this antennae booster on my feature phone (aka dumb phone), giving me an extra bar.  There were several occasions when I was able to make calls with zero bars.  ZERO!\n",
      "\n",
      "So after getting my HTC Thunderbolt from Verizon, I thought I'll give this booster another try and see if it'll enhance my reception.  Instead, it killed data reception.  I lost 4G and even 3G connection.  I should've known not to mess with the internal antennae of the phone.  Once I peeled off the booster, my 4G was fine again!  Buyers/Users beware! Come on Amazon, I can't really believe you are selling this under your own name! Want to try one? They sell these at the dollar stores. It does nothing to improve your signal. Returning. This thing is to small, not even close. Crap I was excited about this band.\n",
      "DOES NOT FIT MOTOR 360 2ND GEN SMART WATCH. Had to return it due to it being Too Huge. The band is very, very long and for some folks with small wrists even the last hole to snap the slack in is not enough. This phone is ugly and heavy and has a terrible user interface even for techies like myself.  It also drops calls like crazy here in Manhattan.  The Moto V600 is a much better phone, takes better pictures, gives you better clarity and reception, is smaller, and is much, much cheaper.  Get the Moto V600 if you want T-Mobile.  Stay away from this ugly monster. I had been very happy with my Motorola phone until the battery started losing its charge within a day, even when the phone was turned off. The friendly but incompetent customer support kept me on the phone for an average of 40 minutes for the repeated calls trying to figure out the problem. After the phone had finally been sent to their technical service center, they returned it to me that the phone was irreperable \"due to customer abuse.\" I have done nothing to that phone that could have caused any damage (unless using it to make phone calls counts as \"customer abuse\"), but got the same comment, without explanation after I had sent the phone in for a second time for reevaluation. It seems that Motorola is just trying to get out of fixing or replacing the phone free of charge under warranty. You'll be fine with a Motorola phone as long as it works. After that, you're on your own. I returned. it did not fit the cycle computer. I guess it is not correctly described. Sorry to say that the product didn't even charge from day one. It plugged in. Lit up and when I came to check there was no power. So connect to charger again and same thing. After 5 times, gave up and returned. May be I just got a lemon. I don't know but don't want to try again. I returned this Item because it didn't filt my Palm Z22 at all. DO NOT BUY THIS FOR THE Z-22. I purchased this case as a package with the Palm TX from amazon. I wish I had read others reviews because as the others pointed out it does not fit the Palm TX. The top sticks out. I went to staples and bought the right case and was told the ones that fit the Palm TX have to say compatible with Tungsten T5. So Im not sure why amazon has a deal with the Palm TX when it isn't the right case. Another thing is it doesn't have a snap only a pull through strap which doesn't stay put too good. This would not stick on my dashboard regardless of what I tried.  I threw it away. Everything sticks to the path BUT the path dos not stick anything  Don't stick at all slides around on my dashboard ok very bad service do not recommend at all do not get these I purchased an item days ago with out the fee. I purchased the very same item days later and now there's an \"estimated regulatory cost recovery fee\".\n",

      "Or, does this mean that I got money back?\n",

      "That being said, I have no idea what this was for, but they're asking for a review..... Basically another way for a phone company to give it to you in a not so nice way so they can line their pockets and not yours. But yeah we still pay it because well just about ever carrier charges you the individual for something bogus. Well here is AT&T Bogus charge. It's not required for them to charge it but they still do because even though their plans are over over priced they still think it's too hard for them to lose bairly more than a dollar to the \"CHANCE\" of having to pay some regulatory fee. Yep, we (consumers) allow phone companies to charge us this 'optional' charge. ... It is obviously a government allowed ripoff that just goes to line the caughers of the phone companies.  They charge it for land lines AND wireless connections.  Just check ALL your phone bills.  I would not be supprised to see the cable companies be allowed to charge this same fee. I tried this out because my old Bluetrek that I loved died.  Actually, I killed it when I forgot where it was and sat on it.  I was impressed with the advertised battery life, and took the plunge.  Shouldn't have.  While it is SUPPOSED to work in a range of 33 feet, I found that if I merely put the phone on the opposite side of my body, the connection gets fickle.  You get lots of staticy noise if the phone is more than 2 feet from the earpiece and in a direct line of sight.  Sort of defeats the purpose of the bluetooth technology, doesn't it?  And the static is NOT just in your end; my girlfriend complained about it more than I really even heard it.  So if yo get this, be prepared to anger your party on the other line.  On the plus side, the sound is nice and loud in th speaker.  That's about it.  Try something else, like a bluetrek or motorola or something.  I am trying the Motorola next.  This thing is trash. This headset was a piece of junk right out of the box. I had nothing but problems with it and threw it away after the first day. STAY AWAY Update 4/2018. I didn't think it possible, but science has increased to the point where, well we split atoms? Right? Well now they've managed to SPLIT THE LEATHER ATOM. Now for a mere 32 dollars you can own you very own ONE MOLECULE THICK LEATHER FANNYPACK. Please don't place anything in the pack that might be pointy or hard, say a tissue or piece of paper, it will rapidly tear through the one molecule of leather this junk bag is made of. The seller won't even stand behind this product, told me to contact the manufacturer, yeah good luck with that, like they might care about a single buyer, HA HA HA. So sorry to tell you, the old one I have from about 8 years ago, that was great, this current paper thin one, absolute waste of money. Please look elsewhere. I think I'm going to bite the bullet and have one custom made with real leather, not the \"black leather paper\" this one is made from\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me say I've been wearing fanny packs for over 15 years, so I'm kind of an \"expert\". This is, hands down, the most durable, functional and well thought out pack.

      "I wish CHINESE crap would stay in china.... I am currently on my replacement V600 which is now acting up.  The first attempt at this and the V600 stopped taking a charge.

T-Mobile is doing what they can to help me as I love T-mobile, but hate the V600.

      "The pictures I took with it turned out fine, I loved the BlueTooth connections, and when I could use the phone there were no connection problems.  The hardware is the problem and I can't or won't waste more time on this. Flimsy, low quality junk that arrived with a broken ear piece. I can't imagine how these got 4 stars. They won't stay in my ears no matter what size tips I try. And, they sound terrible. No base and very tinny. My $10 cheap earbuds sound 10 times better than these. Returning. Could never get it too work for my note 5, I was very disappointed THEY ARE DEAD! I got these on Sunday 8/9/15... They worked. Sound wonderful. No choppy reseption even 40+ feet away!. Used them at work... And they did the job. I was pleased with them up to this point. Today, went to the gym and they worked wonderful. Get done with a 30 min run and they are now dead! I shopped and shopped. Researched and the opinions all said this is such a good unit.\n",

      "My experience is dramatically different. Folks on the other end of the connection complain about the noise and poor voice quality EVERY SINGLE TIME. It is not useable. Very disappointed. Expected that my audio quality would be good and would be fun to use to listen to music. WRONG. What I heard was low volume and low fidelity. Not good for listening to music.\n",

      "BTW, this is unit #2. Ordered one a few months ago. Returned it for the same reasons. Not usable. Very poor audio performance. Thought it was a unit failure. So tried ordering it again. No such luck. Keep looking. There are bound to be better out there.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just ordered a Plantronics Legend. Many have recommended it as a classic best choice. Unfortunately it is only one ear. Better than crappy performance in 2 ears. This headset has one non-fatal design Flaw and one fatal one. The non fatal one is that the power switch is positioned so it lays against your neck when you are wearing it. Irritating, but tolerable. But the real reason for the 1 star review is that I bought mine 20 days ago and today it stopped working. I usually don't buy anything rated < 4 stars but My wife bought me one of these for Christmas and I liked it enough to get another. The first one is still working so maybe the second one is a fluke. We'll see. Surprisingly comfortable. You can measure the reception with a broken ruler, though. If I have to hold my phone next to my ear to keep the audio from dropping, then you've failed at being wireless. ONE MORE UPDATE #2:  After glueing the rubber strips down for the third time last night, when I got up this morning and picked up my buds to use them, the rubber stripping was popped up again on one side. That was discouraging, but I might have been able to live with it, except that it would expose the inside wiring to all kinds of environmental debris and eventually shorten the life of the earbuds. The thing that finally made me decide to return them (with a heavy heart) was that the sound quality had deteriorated noticeably in the right earbud when I was doing my (low impact) workout this morning. It was crackling and popping and fading in and out, which it had never done before. I don't know if this is due to me trying to glue down the rubber stripping (I used the blunt end of a sewing needle to apply the glue, so it was a precision glue job, I'll tell you!), or if the headset itself was just falling apart, but that was the last straw. It's obvious that there is either an engineering, manufacturing, or quality problem with this product. So I would caution would-be buyers to consider this carefully before investing your money in these earbuds. Amazon was very good about sending me a return label, so they're packed up and ready to go to UPS tomorrow, but what a sad experience. I really thought I had found the perfect Bluetooth headphones!!! Let the buyer beware - it may have been that I just got a bad pair, but I read at least one other review that mentioned this very same problem with the rubber stripping underneath the \"collar\", so I know I was not the only one. That's really bad, that these earbuds went from five stars two days ago to one star today.\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE #1 - IMPORTANT: It's ONE DAY after I wrote my stellar review on these earbuds. Well, folks, this morning I went to put on my Motorola Buds and - you guessed it - a problem. As noted in at least one other review, the rubbery trim on the bottom of the headset stalks has separated from the unit, on both sides. I just spent a half hour trying to glue the trim back down, and it kept coming up again, no matter how carefully I applied the glue. THIS SHOULD NOT BE NECESSARY. I have had these for just under two weeks and this SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING.  This is the part that rests against your neck and collarbone, so it SHOULD be fastened (by whatever means necessary) well enough that the trim does not separate, because this is the part of the earbud \"stalks\" that is going to receive the most friction by rubbing against your skin. I can't believe Motorola did not either engineer this better or manufacture it so that this would not be a problem. I am MOST disappointed in this occurrence. I just reapplied the glue for the third time and I'm letting it sit, if it doesn't work this time, back they go. I realize these are not the most expensive buds on the market, but two weeks of wear and it's falling apart????? So now we're down to three stars, instead of the five they had yesterday. Because they're NOT holding up well, even over the short run. Below you'll find my original review, before this morning's problem:\n",
      "\n",
      "Original review: I LOVE THESE BUDS!!!!! I have had them for about ten days or so, so I can't speak to how well they'll hold up over time. Now, for me to say I love ANY earbuds is a huge compliment, because I have gone through at least a dozen pairs (or more) of various designs of earbuds, trying to find that \"perfect\" fit/sound/convenience factor. At first, I was a little hesitant about ordering something that went around my neck and then had the wires that went up to my ears, being used to the usual design of most of the earbuds on the market. And I wasn't sure I wanted to be walking around my workplace with a piece of hardware around my neck on a daily basis. However, there is a photograph of a woman wearing a pair of these on the Amazon page, and they didn't look that bad, just kind of different. So I took the plunge and ordered a set of black ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was very pleased with how easily these buds paired with both my Moto-E phone and my iPads, so that is a plus. The acid test was: how well would they hold up at work? I am at work approximately nine hours a day and I just knew I would have to take these buds off and charge them at some point during the day. I was also wondering how long they would take to charge. Well, let me tell you, they played music continuously for the ENTIRE 9 hours. It was only when I was on my way home that I got the little voice that said \"Low battery\". So I can listen to music all day long without recharging these earbuds, and I think that's fabulous. I work in a very distracting and sometimes loud environment, so my music is what helps to calm and focus me. My last set of Bluetooth earbuds would only play for two hours without running out of power and having to be recharged for almost an hour. So that was three recharges per day - pretty poor, compared to these buds. The Motorola buds fully charge in roughly 90 minutes - not long at all, for the battery life you get.  An extra bonus with these earbuds: I can walk clear to the back of our building from my desk (about 75 feet) and still get signal, albeit spotty. And that's through three interior walls!\n",

      "As far as looks and comfort, having these earbuds around my neck doesn't bother me at all. They might look a little \"different\" to someone who doesn't know what they are, but they save my sanity at work so I don't care. As an aside for any ladies considering these, they don't mess up your hair!!!!  And they are lightweight to the point of me forgetting I even have them on a lot of the time. As other people have observed, they are designed well enough that they don't twist around that much on my neck. Occasionally they get a little cockeyed, but not that much, because if they get too far out of alignment the earbuds themselves will not fit correctly, so it's kind of a self-correcting situation. The other thing is, I am horribly earbud-challenged. Earbuds do NOT stay in my ears, with the exception of the standard Apple earbuds. These earbuds have a unique design that somehow manages to fit in both of my ears, and they stay put, for the most part. I do, however, have to fool with them some to get that \"perfect seal\". But it's getting easier as time goes by. I have had occasion to take a phone call using these (I normally don't get outside phone calls during my work day), and they functioned perfectly for that as well. I was afraid maybe the caller might not be able to hear me, but he indicated it was not a problem at all and could hear me just fine. The controls are pretty easy to use once you get to know which button does what. Sound quality is, for me, excellent. I am not an audiophile, so I can't address the finer points of the quality of the sound, but it works perfectly for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only concern now is how long these Motorola earbuds will last. I have noticed some reviews that complained about that very issue, so I am watchfully waiting to see how they do. However, as with all my electronics, I am extremely careful with them, never bang them around, drop them, or expose them to moisture. I am hoping they last a good long time, because I am very, very happy with them and feel like I have FINALLY come to the end of my long search for the perfect earbuds to wear at work. I can't even tell you how many pairs of earbuds I've gone through over the last six years, but it's been a LOT, and they've all been discarded or given away, because of one reason or another, usually for not fitting/staying properly in my ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "My verdict on these Motorola earbuds, after 10 or so days of use? Five stars. And I would give them six if I could. However, as I said, I will be watching closely for any signs of premature failure, and will update this review should that happen. Right now I'm a VERY happy camper, and would recommend them without any reservation whatsoever. Worked for about 2 months. At 1st it wouldn't turn on unless you connect it back to the charger then unconnect about 2-3 times. Then the volume got stuck on low and will not get any louder. Pro's\n",

      "If it did not quit on me I would certainly recommend it as a phone headset. I had been very happy with my Motorola phone until the battery started losing its charge within a day, even when the phone was turned off. The friendly but incompetent customer support kept me on the phone for an average of 40 minutes for the repeated calls trying to figure out the problem. After the phone had finally been sent to their technical service center, they returned it to me that the phone was irreperable \"due to customer abuse.\" I have done nothing to that phone that could have caused any damage (unless using it to make phone calls counts as \"customer abuse\"), but got the same comment, without explanation after I had sent the phone in for a second time for reevaluation. It seems that Motorola is just trying to get out of fixing or replacing the phone free of charge under warranty. You'll be fine with a Motorola phone as long as it works. After that, you're on your own. I tried this boost antenna on two different cell phones and received no better signal reception. I was careful to follow all instructions and tried a couple different positions but did not receive any increase in signal power that I could measure. I guess I got what I paid for. I recommend anyone considering this product to not consider this no matter what the price is. I get bad reception in my apartment and bought this hoping it would help, but unfortunately it doesn't not give me better recepetion AT ALL. Don't waste your money, even if it's just a couple dollars. Read up, research, and you'll see the folly of these things. No changes to reception. This is just a sticker. Didn't work for me. I had high hopes but ended up wasting my money. Don't waste your money, don't even take them if there're free This device does not work or should I say it did not boost any extra signal for me or my family's cell phone devices.  Heck the pack of 6 was under $5, so what did I expect?! Doesn't do anything, unless it actually made my signal worse. Good thing it was so inexpensive. No change with the signal of my samsung s3 and s4. nokia n series and LG phones... They don't work... These seemed to only create a sticky mess behind my battery cover. My signal never boosted. I have not seen any difference whatsoever Totally a scam.  Never worked  and I should have known better, don't waste your time just get a better phone or service a waste. a rip off. do not buy these.  they don't work at all.  as seen on tv, yea ok! THIS ITEM HELPS SOME BUT NOT A LOT. NEED THE REPEATER TO HELP BOOST SIGNAL. THIS DISTRIBUTOR DID NOT READ THE DESCRIPTION OF THE ORDER. HAD TO CONTACT CUSTOMER SERVICE 3 X. Tried it in my phone and gave out two more for other people, and the feeling the same for all\n",
      "of us, Although these are cheap, a piece of tin foil would have the same results, which is NONE.\n",
      "A total waste of money. you do not get a 6 pack you only get 1 of them do not be fooled i was very upset that it only came with one and i do not liked to be tricked like that do not purchase this as it does not work. my cell phone reception did not improve at all. a total waste of money. I PUT THIS PRODUCT IN MY PHONE AND HAVE NOT SEEN ANY DIFFERENCE IN MY SIGNAL STRENGTH AT ALL. I BOUGHT SOME BEFORE AND THEY ACTUALLY HELPED BUT THESE DID NOT. these things are ajoke they do nothing for the phone but for the price it was a fun thing to try. but really not worth a dime I purchased a screen protector for my phone and received one of these as a \"free gift with purchase.\" I remember seeing these on TV years ago before I even had a cell phone.  I figured I would try it out since I got it as a free bonus, so why not?  I followed the directions (peel off and place under battery; replace battery; turn on phone...etc.) and what happened?  Nothing.  My phone signal did not improve at all.  I left it on for a week and went to various locations.  My signal did not change anywhere I went.  Nothing was \"boosted\" in any way.  I peeled the sticker off and parts of this \"magic gold signal trapper\" came off with it.  I don't think this is any different than a sticker or a Band-aid.  I bet a Band-aid would probably provide more of a signal than this item.  Don't waste your money.  If you get it for free, great, but don't \"install\" it on your phone. It's pointless.  If your phone signal is that bad constantly, switch providers.  Don't buy these Snake Oil Stickers. This sticker is a jock, does nothing to improve signal. I think that at 0.01 plus 4.00 usd shipping is a RIP OFF. You are better off buying something more expensive that works. We've struggled with one of these units - bought at a car stereo store and professionally installed - for around 3 years now and are finally giving up.\n",

      "I can't believe a company built their earlier reputation with a junk product such as this.  It has been fully replaced once, back to the store we bought it from at least another 4 times - and it just is no good.  I can hear callers fine but no matter what we do with the microphone, moving tweaking gain, even hanging off the visor in front pf my face, my callers hate it for all the background noise, tunnel sounds, static - the mike sucks on this thing.  If I wish for a conversation of any sort, I have to turn it off and put my phone to my ear as callers just can't understand what I am saying.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. The phone activates the second that it ships so you are paying charges the whole time even if you never turn the phone on. So if you talk even one second on the phone, you are paying for at least a week of shipment time as well, so if you don't like the phone don't turn it on.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Cingular doesn't know anything about Amazon as a reseller and Amazon doesn't know anything about Cingular, so what you have to do is to call Cingular and have the UPS tracker for the package so when you return you can prove that you really did. Also, you'll need to print out all the return web pages and fax it to Cingular to prove you really returned it.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. It takes about an hour and a half, but if you are lucky like me, you can get it taken care of. Fifteen months ago I bought my first BB7210, and feel it's one of the best business tools I've ever used. Battery life was good for at least two days talking 3-4 hours per day or 5-6 days in low use, and the integration of Outlook with the phone was AWESOME. In Dec. 04, I upgraded to the BB7290 mainly for the Bluetooth feature. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! Battery life barely gets me through a day, and the lag time from menu to menu is much slower than the BB7210. The unit is slightly larger and heavier than the BB7210. After using the device for only two days, callers could NOT hear my voice, though I could hear them clearly, and I had a great signal? Cingular is replacing the device; however, RIM will need to make some serious changes for me to be as enthusiastic as I was over the BB7210. Very cheap It says it's compatible with all Motorola handsets...  It doesn't work at all with Motorola/Giant Talkabout FRS/GMRS/CB 2-way radios having 2.5mm jacks.  Very disappointing. Item arrived defective. I wired everything up correctly and it did not work. I ran down to Napa bought another model hooked it up the same way and the Napa one works great. Poor quality and unless you want to waste your money don't buy this. For one, this product is built very cheap. This means that overtime some ports will simply stop working...why? I'm not really sure...perhaps cheap components, and slight bending?\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, it does not support charging, and yet it does at the same time. If you plug in say an apple device you'll get an error, but it will charge which again does not make sense.\n",

      "Lastly: Mine is just about destroyed, because of a slight drink mishap. Nothing seems to be wrong with device other than...it stops working from time to time, and I sometimes have to clean the ports with a small amount of water to get it to work again..just very annoying.\n",

Eventually the two bottom ports simply decided to \"not work\" entirely which is completely stupid because I rarely ever used those ports to begin with. This also made me think there was something wrong with my device, and wasted my time trouble shooting. (just had to switch ports) In other words...\n",

I can see most of the file structure but copying attempts fail. The powered external hard drive mostly worked for a couple days and then quit. One portable hard drive never worked again. The optical drive still works, occasionally, but typically won't boot. Occasionally the printer works. The mice never worked again. And the keyboard was fine.  Everything's been tested on 3 different PC systems and 1 Linux system.\n",

      "The worst part? Those were my redundant data storage. I lost everything. I cannot have this hub connected to my Dell PC when I reboot as my PC will not boot up at all when it is connected.  While it could be a PC issue, I find it interesting that I don't experiencing the problem when the hub is not connected.  I previously had the 4 port Cyberpower USB2 hub and loved it, but I did not have enough ports for all of my peripherals, however, I have come to regret this purchase.  Again, it could be my PC or maybe I have a defective hub, but I sure wouldn't buy this hub again. I liked this unit when I set it up.  It had a small footprint, was heavy enough to be solid on the desk, and had a funky kind of look to it.  I had to return it, though.  It wasn't reliable.  My devices weren't registering on my PC.  I plugged them into another hub and they worked fine, but they didn't work on this hub.  I should say they initially worked, then didn't.  One at a time, each device I plugged into it worked, then didn't.  I tried unplugging it and then plugging it back in, but nothing.  I bought a cables to go model at the same time and that was solid (but $10 more).  I returned this unit and ordered another CTG unit. Maybe I got one that was made poorly, but it didn't fit the phone at all. The quality of the material was pretty good, though. I should have listened to the reviews on this item. I decided to buy it anyway and what a disapointment it was. It never worked and the connection to the TREO was horrible. I have learned a lesson about after market products and will not be buying products from these companies to save a few dollars. I bought this thinking it would be perfect for what I wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wall adapter dosn't work at all and the end of the cable that plugs into the phone has slowly been chipping away to the point that it is now impossible to plug it correctly into the phone.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I know bluetooth headsets are a personal preference. This one looks nice but  the sound and the fit are poor. I have owned 5+ headsets and this was one of the worst. I now have a Plantronic and both the sound and fit are great. Listening at my end was very noisy unless the phone held near the headset. Sound quality at the other end of the line was fine, said several listeners.\n",

      "A definite \"don't buy\" Perhaps I just got a bad one, but this thing won't consistently work 4 feet away from the phone, let alone the 30 they claim. It's a nice design, and if it worked I'd be very happy with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE: I just got a new BT250v after Amazon was kind enough to exchange my unit sight unseen (they even shipped out the new unit before I'd shipped back the bad one). Unfortunately, while the new unit works somewhat better, it still doesn't work as well as it should. For example, there is noticeable popping (interference) if i put my phone in my pocket, even on the same side as the headset. I've tried many combinations of phone and headset, and the only time I have problem is with this headset, so I'm quite sure it's not an issue with my phone, or with bluetooth in general. (In fact, I've had far better luck with other Jabra BT products.) So, the design is beautiful and the product is great when it works, but I've found that it fails when I really need it.\n",
      "\n",
      "FINAL UPDATE: I chucked it. Don't believe the breathless reviews about this. If you use this in everyday life--i.e. with the phone more than a few feet from your head--people on the other end will hear static. I got so sick of people asking me \"what's that clicking sound?\" that I threw the stupid thing away. I'm amazed people love this so much. They must be so floored by the idea of wireless technology they haven't actually tried using it for a real conversation, or they haven't actually tried to call another person. With two bad experiences with this company, that was the last Jabra product I'll ever buy. The range on the headset was pathetic - maybe 2 or 3 feet from the phone to get a decent signal (which defeats the entire puprpose of a CORDLESS headset IMHO).  Otherwise, it was horrific - static, terrible sound quality, etc.  Please do not waste money on that POS.  I swapped it out for the Moto H850 and am much happier with that unit paired up with my MotoE815. Product did not work. Will not pair with phone. When it does it drops ur call. Over and over like the fit snooges your ear. As a long-time Motorola bluetooth headset user, I can tell you from painful experience that there are fundamental flaws in the HS850.  In fact, I went through FOUR HS850 headsets (under warranty) before Motorola decided to upgrade me to the H700 (despite the lower model number, the H700 is a newer model).\n",
      "\n",
      "The HS850 and H700 have the same characteristics:\n",
      "- Over-the-ear swing arm earpiece that can be used on left or right ear\n",
      "- Flip-open boom microphone that turns the headset on/off\n",
      "- Easy volume controls\n",
      "- Toggle switch to connect/disconnect calls (or put them on hold/mute)\n",
      "- Easy pairing\n",
      "- Good published battery life\n",
      "- Standard Motorola power connectors\n",
      "\n",
      "What's the difference?  Well, \"good published\" battery life is the distinction.  All four of the HS850 headsets worked for a few weeks or months, but then would not hold a charge.  Battery life went down to MINUTES.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dealing with Motorola support was a nightmare.  Apparently, their support center for these products was in Argentina, and they could only do what was in their script to help me.  After the fourth failure, I insisted on getting a support contact at their corporate HQ in Illinois.  That support contact was a dream.  After reviewing my case, he gave me the H700 as a replacement.  I had that headset for 1.5 years, and it had kept its battery life and functionality.  Of course, I lost it and had to buy a replacement...and given all the choices, I got another H700.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do NOT fall for the lower price of the HS850.  I've seen prices as low as $15 for this model.  I think you'll be frustrated and disappointed in the end. I returned this product because it was clearly a used headset.  There were scratches on the front, and a small dent.  Frankly I do not want to insert a used product into my ear.  I went to Wal-mart and bought the very same product for less money. You would think if you made a headset for the Motorola RAZR you would use the same power adapter. So even though you primarily use the headset in the car the genius that developed this product used a completely differnt plug. So if you have the car adapter to power your phone you have to buy a different car power adapter for this headset. Great thinking product team. I say look for the version that is cheaper then this one. It shares the same plug (universal USB) so you can charge it in the car as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Update: didn't mean just Motoral RAZR. If your phone doesnt have a USB charger great, if not the charge plug for this earpiece is unique. Also, reception and volume is terrible. Look someplace else. Really. One of the most worthless items I've ever had. No troubleshooting information in the manual. Works when it wants as opposed to when I want. Charge doesn't seem to last a day without any use. Whoever thought a blue flashing light on your ear was stylish should get a lobotomy.  It's worked twice in three weeks and instead of answering the last call, it just beeped incessantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I'll give up on bluetooth. And I'll certainly have nomo Moto!\n",
      "\n",
      "One star because Amazon will not let me give it a lower vote. I own this headset and the sound quality is very poor.  I end up having to pick up the handset manually so I can hear the person on the other end.  This defeats the purpose of hands free in a car.  In a quiet room it works fine.  Do not buy this if you intend to use it in a car, bus or train. There is no volume set on it for your voice no one can here me - I wish I did not throw away the package After a week the headset would hang up while I was talking, also it would dial out for no reason, I use to own a HS850 before it got stolen from me, this one here I threw out the window a couple days ago. I think it was refurbed Why all manufacturers don't use the standard universal USB charging adapter is beyond me. If you own a Motorola RAZR or other phone that uses USB charging then you will need another charger for this one. Also the earpiece doesnt fit well on your ear, infact i have had it blow off when I rolled down the window. I recommend going to a store and trying a few on before you buy. Plus the volume and reception is terrible. Any ambient noise and you can't hear your call. I also notice it may still have a charge but once it gets low it loses connection with my phone. So the total 'usage' time is about an hour. My advice, keep looking. JUNK Don't purchase.  This never work properly and fell apart.  It is the worst purchase I ever made.  Spend a little more and get something useful !!! I wish there was a way to rate this item ZERO stars. This is not worth the plastic and wires it's made out of or the cheap price. Save your pocket change, it's not even worth the effort of buying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each person I used this set with said that it was difficult to hear me and that everything sounded muffled. I wasn't sure if it was the headset or the phone. After getting another headset, it definitely was the this piece of junk. Even though this ear piece is designed for a razor phone, the ear bud is too big, uncomfortable and it keeps falling off the ear. After two weeks of use, the on/off switch stopped working, and this feature was the main reason why I bought this unit. In sum, it was a waste of money. There was no provision in this review for \"0\" stars, so I gave it \"1\" The sound is horrible... people say I sound like I am in a muffled tunnel. And I bought two, to have in case the BT ran down.... poor me..... And my Plantronics 620 works like cr*p too. No noise cancellation worth a d*mn... forget about using it when driving a car.... I am trying to find a new one... I've had several cases, Krusell, Vaja and Sena but this has to be the worst of the bunch. Krusell has never nor will ever be in the Vaja and the Sena class but they've usually for the money been descent. The charging port was halfway covered by the leather! I tried to pull it up further so it would line up to the hole and the leather that's sewn to the plastic bottom ripped. GAME OVER! The clip that comes with it will not swivel either. Totally useless, waste of money. Live and learn. I don't see what others have liked about this.  It doesn't add any value -- doesn't make the phone easier to carry or use, doesn't add significant protection, or do anything else.  I'd recommend getting a pouch with a slide-on clip, that holds the phone horizontally on your belt or waistband. I had been very happy with my Motorola phone until the battery started losing its charge within a day, even when the phone was turned off.

Not happy Old Bought this product for my Att 4s Iphone, when I could of got it free from them. Price was right but check first with your cell phone provider they will give you a free one.

I needed it for work and used it A LOT, I really put it through its paces. It worked great for months, so I bought the version of this headset for my husband that doesn't have the dongle. Both worked for months. Then mine won't turn on. Customer service gave me some suggestions, none of which worked. They sent me a new one. I was delighted.

I've gone thru 3 of these already, in the last year or so...I trusted the reviews here and like how comfortable it fits on the ear...but it just doesn't last! after a few months it would automatically lose signal for some darn reason! just yesterday I noticed my iphone can't pick up the signal to this thing anymore, and I just changed a new one like 4 months ago! darn piece of junk...I'm no longer supporting this brand for sure! ****UPDATED on OCT. 18, 2010\n",

      "I really tried to make this work for me but it just is not worth the hassle.  As previously speculated, I wonder if wearing glasses is the reason for the poor fit. I traveled quite a bit last weekend and found that, more often than not, my headset disconnected itself from my phone after a call.  My hands-free-device turned into a pull-over-and-muck-with-it-after-each-call burden.  Maybe I didn't have some obscure setting correct but I looked all over and couldn't find one.  Maybe mine was defective, I'm not sure but it was really more trouble than it was worth.  In almost ten years of ordering from Amazon I am taking advantage of the return policy for the first time.\n",

      "I found a different headset at 73% off but still $40 (orig $150 / Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece in gold) and it comes with its own chargeable case. Never seen a case that not only protects but also charges!  Other colors are a bit more. Check that one out if you wear glasses.  It fits into the ear, not over the top, so I am hoping for a better fit.\n",

Amazing in itself but you could barely tell the difference from \"all windows up\" and \"driver/passenger window down.\"\n",

      "HOWEVER.... I wear glasses and have a rounder face.  It is difficult to place the earpiece on my ear with glasses on.  The bulky part doesn't sit well on my glasses' frame.  The mouthpiece is not adjustable.  I have fuller cheeks and the mic comes in contact with my face.  Not sure why it was made that way since not all faces are the same.  The control buttons are also difficult to manage while driving.  The main control on the side is fine but the tiny on/off and volume buttons were hard to find and press without dislodging the unit.  I turn it on before I place it on my ear.  Maybe that has something to do with it sitting on my eyeglasses frame. I do like the sound quality and will continue to use it for a while before coming back to update.  If it doesn't work well for me I'm sure one of my kids will like it.  (I ended up returning it.

      "Would also recommend getting a case for it to corral the charger and unit in one place. I had Jabra when it first came out, its battery stopped charging after 10 months. So I got this one as a replacement, it too stopped charging after a year. This is the problem with all BT earpieces, its battery is not replaceable which can be done if the industry wants to. They make more money by selling the whole unit vs we pay 5-10 dollars to replace battery. This kind of practice is not sustainable. I'm now back to the wired headset. My friend recommended this product to me and he was right it works great. I tried so many more before I decided on this one. A Little bulky but for the clarity you get I can live with that. As many people complained, I found this headset's microphone was very weak. The other person can not hear me at all.  So I contacted Plaintronics for repair.  Their repair process has no tracking, just sending in your headset to an address.  Two weeks later, I received a used one back, not the one I sent in, packaged in an OEM box. Although this one has better microphone than the new one I sent in, it battery is not very reliable to hold charge, also the battery portion is kind of loose.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can not recommend Plantronics product at all. I tried two of these headsets and it was horrible for the person I was speaking to. Some heard the echo worse than the others, but all heard it. Some heard every word they said repeated back to them nearly as loud as my voice. Annoying to say the least and THANK YOU Amazon for being so amazing and taking both headsets back! This is possibly the best headset ever made from an audio standpoint.  BUT, GIVE ME BREAK PLANTRONICS!!! WHY don't you quit coming out with marginal models and re-design this so that the BTE unit isn't quite so big and especially long?? This model has been out long enough and only needs to be tweeked a little and shrunk slightly and everyone should buy it!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Your other, much smaller models don't compare in sound quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "So how about the best of both worlds for those of us that have been spoiled by the 510 but can't quite stand the bulk, and it being flipped off our ear by the bottom of the BTE hitting our jacket collar??!! I returned this headset even before I got to use it!  Poor build quality.  It felt comfortable, but I couldn't even charge it to use it.  The charger plug (where it plugs into the headset) is so tiny and horrible designed that it wasn't making a good connection with the contacts and wouldn't charge.  I'd much prefer a mini USB plug (which is somewhat standard in the mobile phone industry).\n",
      "\n",
      "The eartip that goes into the ear has a poor design in how it is attached.  You have to turn it *counter*-clockwise to mount it and that's opposite of everything I've ever seen. I damn near broke the ear tip thinking I had to turn it clockwise (like everything else in the world!).  The volume up/down buttons seemed loose and were also very awkward to adjust with the headset on your ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "After figuring out how to attach the ear tip, I wanted to take it off to try on one of the other two (3 total) ear tips that came with it (different sizes and form fit).  But I couldn't even get the original one off!  I had to ship it back with it on and it made the packaging kind of bulge.\n",

      "The headset came with an owner's manual (many pages), and quick-start \"card\" and another sheet of paper for quick pairing instructions.

      "This product is lousy and isn't worth a hill of beans.  I returned it promptly. Headset has quite bad microphone; people complain much more than with my old Motorola Headset about the voice quality and amount of noise. Not worth the price. I returned the Plantronics Voyager 510 BlueTooth headset simply because I wasn't comfortable with the in ear fit. This is a purely personal opinion and reflects nothing on the quality of the product. If you want an \"in\" ear bluetooth then by all means try it - I prefer an \"on\" ear bluetooth and I currently have - and am very satisfied with my - HBH-PV705. I found the ear piece to be very awkward on the ear and the buttons were difficult to use.  I used it for about a month and gave up on it.  Sound wise it was hard to hear if there was any background noise. I bought this primarily for use as a cordless headset for gaming. Setup was tricky: it took two different attempts using different configuration methods to get any sound out of the unit. Once it was connected and configured, I found that it was utterly useless for gaming. There is no way to use both the headset and the PC speakers in the same game. This means that I have the choice of either using my PC's internal card for DoD:S or using the 510. I cannot, for example, use the 510 as a mic and use my speakers for stereo sound. This makes it useless for gaming, since I cannot tell the location of other players and in-game entities by sound. To top it off, the audio quality was abysmal. While I stand by the multiple Plantronics wired headsets I've owned, I was shocked by the  low audio quality of this headset. Both the in-game sound test and a recording program played back my voice with fidelity below that of an old rotary telephone. I am returning this device tomorrow and giving up on Bluetooth entirely after this disappointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a shame that this device performs so poorly. However, this does nothing to shake my faith in Plantronics corded headsets. I fail to understand the high ratings for this headset. I dislike it.\n",

      "While sound quality was quite good, there are several physical attributes that made it less appealing to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with the smallest earpiece, it is uncomfortable in the ear canal. It is bulky, and awkward when worn with eyeglasses or sunglasses. The power switch is difficult to use as well. I can't really think of anything I like about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought it was a decent price at $42, but the $28 Motorola H500 is a no-brainer when compared to this headset. I found this item to be lightweight and comfortable. Sound quality was fairly good. That's about all I can say that is good about it.\n",

      "Talk time is maybe 2 to 2 1/2 hours, stand-by time is about 50 hours, both are less than acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The headset would not accept a charge after about 3 1/2 months of use (light usage at that). It also seemed to have a mind of it's own when it came to staying connected to my phone, constantly having to re-boot phone and device in order to get connection (used with a Samsung cell phone).\n",

      "I would definitely advise others to stay away from this item. Also, Plantronics would not give any assistance and would only refer me to the retailer, zero customer assistance is not a good thing. The product has terrible audio quality with the MacBook Pro.  Plantronics claims that it only works with Cell Phones. I had been very happy with my Motorola phone until the battery started losing its charge within a day, even when the phone was turned off. The friendly but incompetent customer support kept me on the phone for an average of 40 minutes for the repeated calls trying to figure out the problem. After the phone had finally been sent to their technical service center, they returned it to me that the phone was irreperable \"due to customer abuse.\" I have done nothing to that phone that could have caused any damage (unless using it to make phone calls counts as \"customer abuse\"), but got the same comment, without explanation after I had sent the phone in for a second time for reevaluation. It seems that Motorola is just trying to get out of fixing or replacing the phone free of charge under warranty. You'll be fine with a Motorola phone as long as it works. After that, you're on your own. The phone front screen stopped working and the phone didn't seem to have a good reception.  It was a refurbished phone and I wonder if it wasn't put back together well.  I have had to spend money to fix the phone.  I am very disappointed with it. Terrible it came with many scratches to the screen, and after an hour of using it the screen became very distorted. I normally don't tell people not to buy something but trust me save your money and get some thing else. no comment Don't buy this. PHONE WORKED FOR 2 WEEKS...DISSAPOINTED :( junk Its stopped working after an year use. disappointed. Arrived damaged. Deployed and not feasible for me to return. I got it because it would work internationally, which it did...but it was still damanged. Phone did. not work. It powers up but screen remains black. Seems to be a dummy phone that does not function. I purchased three of them in 2 weeks.  The phone is great, but they all have the same problem:  the battery doesn't stay firm in its place and the phone turns off every 5 minutes. El motorola RAZR V3 lo compr bajo la condicin de ser nuevo en el mes de Enero. tres meses despues el celular simplemente dejo de funcionar. Lo llev a un tcnico y me inform que ese celular era reconstruido (ya lo sospechaba dado que el cargador mostraba signos de uso). Es una lastima que por vendedores inescrupulosos uno deje de confiar en el mercado online, sobre todo si vivimos fuera de los Estados Unidos. I had a RAZR V2 and it was the best cell phone I ever had so I up graded to the RAZR V3 late last year (2007).  The RAZR V3 is by far the worst cell phone that I've owned.  It is beautiful and has great features but it keeps failing I have had 5 of these phones so far (the original purchased one plus 4 refurbished replacements) 1st phone: after a couple of months the screen would not light up / 2nd phone would not charge from the get go / 3rd phone after about a month the screen would no longer light up / 4th phone after a couple of months the screen would not light up / 5th phone has been working for about a month now.  I really like the RAZR phones, WHEN THEY WORK but this V3 model has been terrible and I would rate it lower than 1 star if possible. I ordered the cable to use w/ my T/X. It has a different configuration for the connection thus, I cannot use it! 1st set cracked in the center of the headband after about a month.  Once the crack appears the headset starts to disconnect the wires at the crack and the headset stops working entirely.  2nd replacement set cracked after about two weeks.  That was over a year ago, I didn't bother replacing it because why bother.  Then I found out they were issuing a different design entirely as replacements (freepulse).  Don't bother with this design unless it's free. yea they sound great, the bluetooth signal is awesome crystal clear with no hiss or pop or fading in an out. The bad part is the headband breaks for no reason other than just using it. Now I got a $50 piece of junk that I can't use I purchased this last week here at Amazon through CCMAAccessories.\n",

      "\n",
      "On the plus side, it lasts on standby for a few days (vice a few hours like my Sony BT headset does). It fits around my ear, and comfortably in my ear, very easily. The loop is soft rubber, so no sharp or rigid plastic is clamping on your outer ear. If the sound is not quite loud enough (the volume controls are easy to find by touch, but this in-ear speaker can only blast so much), the earbud can be gently pressed in to form a seal, and is easier to hear this way. Sound is so-so, some callers have told me they can't hear me if there's ambient sound, music, wind, or cars nearby. In all, better than average, but this is the second Jabra product that's crapped out on me, so be wary.

      "I've now used this for 2 years and can give it a much better review. The unit has held up well (though the tip broke and had to be glued back). It still holds several hours charge, where my old Sony headset now lasts one 10 minute conversation and dies. The shape, weight, and ergonomic fit are so unobtrusive that I've had some companions remind me I'm still wearing it after hanging up on a call. Although I didn't like the shiny \"bling\" microphone tip, I've now softened on this design. The BT500 is still more attractive and less attention getting than others. Because I have a headset at work, and my new car has a HandsFreeLink feature, I use this unit at home, and after two years, it still works great. I recommend this headset without reservation.

The unit's recepotion constantly broke up in my apartment (I get full strength on my three year old Sanyo with Sprint), and it's really hard to hear on the unit (the volume is awful).  The one bright spot for me was the speaker phone, but that wasn't enough to keep it.  I cancelled my Cingular plan and gave the phone back to Best Buy.  I really liked the style of this phone, but unless you plan to carry a second phone for your calls, I cannot recommend this unit. I had the RAZR (pink) for 2 days and the phone started a low pitched buzzing noise whenever it was on. I got a replacement and the 2nd phone started buzzing after another day. The salesperson said they have had problems with this phone and thought they (Cingular)had returned all the problem phones. Guess not. Now I have to exchange this one too. What a hassle. One the bright side, it has very long battery life and pretty sleek looking. dont buy from amazon if you plan on trasferring some other phone number to this new phone and service. Mail-in-rebate is voided. It is so weired. They make money anyway.

PROBLEM:  After about 3 months the screen would not light up --- took the phone back to AT&T and they sent me a reconditioned phone which lasted about a month --- took that one back, they sent another reconditioned phone,  Long story > short:  I had 5 phones in one year, the 5th phone finally worked and kept working for a couple of years.  Because of my experience with this phone, I will not buy another Motorola. I had been very happy with my Motorola phone until the battery started losing its charge within a day, even when the phone was turned off.

After that, you're on your own. I finally decided to purchase the Razr based on the facts that my current service is not very good in my are, my GF has Cingular(free wireless to wireless), the Razr had tons of cool features, my old phone's battery is dead, and it's the only phone that came close to the thinness of my Sanyo SCP 6200.  Well, I have had this phone for  about 4 days, and I am planning on returning it as soon as the replacement battery for my scp 6200 arrives.  I expected a brand new phone to have better audio clarity than my 4 year old phone.  The sound is so weak, even with the vloume all the way up, that I can not hear anything if there is the slightest amount of background noise, like when driving.......Extremely disappointing.  I'm also concerned with durability, I have a tendency to drop my phones and the V3 does not seem very sturdy.  My Sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect.  Luckily, I found a place to buy a battery for it for only $10.00!  In short, unless you have superb hearing(suprman) I would avoid this phone.  All of the whiz-bang gadgets are useless if the item won't even preform it's main duty of being a phone.  I have also learned that my previous provider is expanding coverage in my are, so I'm glad I didn't cancel my service with them. I bought this item and exchanged it three times because I assumed that I just got a defective one.\n",

      "After trying four units, I've concluded that the product does not work as advertised.  In contrast, I've also tried the Wilson cellular repeaters and they seem to work great. I put the antenna on the very top of my roof with it verticle ran the cable to my computer room and my phone got all 5 bars in the computer room pretty much right next to the unit. Go about 10 feet and the signal goes back down to 1 to 2 to roaming, this is line of sight of the base unit. The manual states that it will cover 2500sq ft, there is no way it would or could cover that much area let alone 10ft. The manual states that the base unit is only a .25watt and talking to a communication buisness that sells similar units that are more high end and are up to 3watts those won't even cover that much area. If you want any mobility to roam around the house and get good signal don't waste your money on this, if you are stationary with your phone or tether it to your desktop then this would work for you.

After the phone had finally been sent to their technical service center, they returned it to me that the phone was irreperable \"due to customer abuse.\" I have done nothing to that phone that could have caused any damage (unless using it to make phone calls counts as \"customer abuse\"), but got the same comment, without explanation after I had sent the phone in for a second time for reevaluation. It seems that Motorola is just trying to get out of fixing or replacing the phone free of charge under warranty. You'll be fine with a Motorola phone as long as it works. After that, you're on your own. BEFORE U BUY THIS DAM THING THINK ABOUT IT TWICE. THIS CASE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ME LOOSING MY PHONE ON THE BUS DUE TO A LOOSE BELT CLIP BUTTON. MOMENTS BEFORE I GOT OFF THE BUS I CLIPPED MY PHONE ONTO MY BELT AND WHEN I GOT OFF TO USE IT IT WAS GONE. I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM BEFORE BUT VERY NICE PEOPLE HAD TOLD ME THAT I FORGOT MY PHONE IN THE PASSENGER SEAT I WAS SITTING ON. THE ONE TIME I DID NOT GET A WARNING WAS PROBALLY WHEN SOMEONE FELL IN LOVE WITH MY MOTOROLA RAZR V3T AND DECIDED TO KEEP IT. IF U REALLY WANT THIS CASE I RECOMMEND THAT U REMOVE THE CLIP ON FEATURE SINCE THIS COVER HAS THAT ABILITY, YOU JUST SLIDE THE BUTTON OFF THAT HOLDS THE BELT HOLSTER AND JUST KEEP THE PHONE IN YOURE POCKET JUST TO BE SAFE. LESSON LEARNED FOR ME AND FROM NOW ON I WILL KEEP MY PHONE IN MY POCKET. NO MORE BELT CLIP HOLSTERS SINCE THESE PHONES ARE SUPER NICE AND EXPENSIVE AND THERES A 95% CHANCE THAT YOU MAY NEVER RECOVER IT IF U EVER LOOSE IT! I threw this thing in the gabarge as soon as I unwrapped it. It looks like it came from the dollar store. battery don't last Oh good didn't work poor reception just bad just don't like it, heavy, feels like it wil fall off, AAA battery powered. not happy with it. doesnt link to music from phone just calls. I bought the Plantronics 320 today. As soon as I walked out the store,the reception went static beyond belief. The salesman said \"Give it a chance\", I have and it's going back tomorrow. For the past week  I've bought 4 headsets(Motorola 500,850,700,& this one which is one of the worst. I found the Motorola 700 to be the best so far.  Clear reception most of the time,excellent volume(no problem hearing while driving),& it always connected to my treo 650.  On a windy day my friend on the other end didn't even know I got out the car,hardly any background noise.  I just ordered the 700 through Amazon,much cheaper than Cingular & Motorola. I guess I would have rated this if I would have received the right product. Instead of getting the Nexus 7 Case, BoxWave sent me a case that looked like above, but was fitted for a Samsung Galaxy SIII Cell Phone. Clearly, someone just looked at the picture on the invoice and guessed at what product was ordered. Won't be ordering from this vendor again. I'm still waiting for my refund... And I'm still without a case. :/ I have been very dissatisfied with this headset, first of all, the battery life is terrible. I can't use it for a long time at once, after about 30 mins, I get a \"weak signal\" alert on my phone. The audio quality is also bad as I have to keep telling the other persons to repeat themselves, and they can't hear me clearly either. Overall, I wish I could return this product, and would definitely recommend against buying it. I've had my pair for four months now they look great and the sound isn't bad overall. But that's where it ends. My pair died and would not recharge and the hinges developed cracks since it has plastic hinges with steel pins holding them together. My friends pair also has cracks in his hinges and i am talking about 2 to 3 cracks. I sent them in and they told me that I should not keep them on the stand when not in use, Isn't that what the stand is for???? not what I was thought it was. wasnt what i needed  didn't seem to have riught info on add  so  wouldnt recomend this proiduct  to buy for anyone This product it is just a waist of your money. Not holding any charging.\n",
      "When I contact the seller first he didnot responed for 4 days and then after I claim with amazon, He make it like it is my fault that I donot know how to instal it.\n",
      "DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM IT IS NOT WORTH A $1. I have purchased 2 of these mounts and each one has lasted for about a year before the arms broke and I had to throw the mount away.  The mount is nice, but not rugged enough.  In the end I wound up purchasing the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Arkon-Vehicle-Specific-Mount-Adapter-Plate-Black/dp/B002CQTYIO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Arkon Vehicle Specific Mount Adapter Plate - Black</a>. I've had this for about a month now, and it's pure garbage.  Everything worked fine at first.  After about 2 weeks, I noticed that the original battery that came with my phone couldn't hold a charge like it used to, so I started using the backup battery almost exclusively.  Next, the cord that you plug into your phone didn't always recognize that it had been plugged in.  I thought it was my phone at first, but I tried plugging in the original charger that it came with a few times and it recognized it easily.  Now I have to play a little game of \"What do we have to do to make the phone recognize the cable today?\" whenever it needs a charge.  Even after I've found the place that it finally recognizes and put it down, I'll get up in the morning to find that the phone hasn't charged at all and is now dead.  Avoid this product at all costs!  There must be a better brand of this product out there somewhere.... Watch out people -- the notched circular connection on these ear cushions does not fit the opening on a Plantronic Voyager Pro -- the diameter is too small, and they fall out. However I ordered the \"medium gel eartips\",&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Plantronics-Medium-Eartips-for-Voyager-Pro-3-Pack/dp/B002QBS9KE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Plantronics Medium Eartips for Voyager Pro [3 Pack</a>] pack of 3, and the connector on those does fit. So I'm keeping the gel eartips (not this item) and throwing out these foam ones. did not worked I bought this one because i miss the old slim fones and bored of the big tablets and phablets of noawadays but i regret wasting money on this product because refurbished can never be as good as new or even close to it: many functions not working, buttons jammed, speakers damaged,,etc NEVER WORK, DONT BUY, THIS IS SALVAGE PRODUCT O R DEFECTIVE LOT OF PRODUCT, NO WONDER THE LOW PRICE. WATCH OUT DONT BUY!! Has good looks and size, special features not compatible with smartphones like treo palm, must have a motorola phone for it to work good, battery lifecycle not good, used it for about 3 months and battery never worked again :( Once I received my headset and read the instructions, I proceeded to charge it using the charger that came with it. After 30 minutes of charging I heard a slight \"pop\" sound that came from the charger's plug. I quickly noticed that the light on the headset showing that charging was taking place, had gone out.  I didn't smell any smoke thankfully and I checked to ensure my wall receptacle socket was alright. No problems at my wall socket, I plugged in other items to ensure all was well with my wall socket.\n",
      "\n",
      "I then plugged in the charger to other wall receptacles and the charger no longer worked. There was no charging light on the headset!! Talk about being mad!!  But the little amount of charging to the headset before the charger crapped out, was enough for me to test out the headset.  It worked just fine. And it worked for a few days. I guess the 30 minutes or so of charging was adequate for a couple of days of use.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm just mad because the charger went bad after only 30 minutes of use. Also, there was no electrical storm or anything occurring with the weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I returned the item and I'm still waiting to receive the replacement from Amazon, even though their email told me my replacement has been shipped via USPS and it should be delivered by June 4th. Well it is now June 8th, and still I have no replacement headset delivered.  Amazon sent me an email advising me that they received my defective headset/charger 3 days ago. So where is my replacement AMAZON!!!! I threw it out because of terrible Volume/clarity on both ends.  Go for the Scala 500- I just bought my second (lost my first) and it's the best on the market. Microphone was so quiet as to be inaudible unless you spoke *really* loudly, which I don't like to do on a cell phone. The mike also picked up a lot of background noise. Sent it back. The best place in my house for reception is the third floor attic of my townhouse. I receive 1/2 bar at best on the ground floor where the line often goes dead, but 1.5 bars and consistent reception in the attic.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I set this up in my attic as per the instuctions, and extended the line downstairs, but there absolutely was no improvement in my reception anywhere in the room.  Tried several adjustments of location, but it still didn't work.\n",
      "\n",
      "They took it back as a return with no problem.  I don't know if the one I received was defective, or if it just doesn't work in the conditions in my townhouse. Have AT&T & a lousy signal in my house (had the same problem with Sprint, but bought a booster that DID work from Spotwave).  Don't bother with this product.  It is going back. 'I hate my treo' is a daily term I tend to say...often out loud in frustration.  I try to put in a simple calendar reminder...it crawls, or freezes.  I usually have the reset the phone once a day after it crashes.  The memory allocation is terrible.  Sometimes, just making a simple call is the hardest thing to do.  I hope I don't have to dial 911 with it...I fear it may take me a good minute for it to dial as I wait for this junk to catch up with itself.\n",

If you're a former Palm PDA user, you'll hate this as a PDA (and probably as a phone as well).  My company recently switched from the Blackberry platform to Windows Mobile.  For secrity reasons, the only device initially approved for use on the WM platform is the Treo 700W, so I had no choice but to go with this dog.  It tries to do everything but ends up doing nothing well.  My review will focus on a comparison with the Blackberry platform (I was using a 7290).\n",

      "\n",
      "-- Awkward implementation of shift and function keys; one major flaw is that the only way to type a capital letter is to use the shift key; you can't simply hold down a letter key until it produces a capital, as you can on the BB.\n",
      "\n",
      "-- Predictive typing is virtually useless.  It seldom produces the most obvious word, i.e., the one you'd expect.  Accidentally type a nonstandard spelling (easy to do, since it's so hard to type on this keyboard), and the prediction feature will repeat the new \"word\" until you select a similar word with different spelling.\n",
      "\n",
      "-- Extremely cluttered interface.  Doing just about anything involves navigating menus, and there's no scroll wheel, so you can't do it one-handed: you have to use the stylus.\n",
      "\n",
      "-- Using the address book to dial a number is painful.  Type in the first letter of a person's name - say \"D\" - and you'll get every name that begins with that letter, whether a first name or last name.  To pick the name you actually want, you then have to navigate the list with the stylus.  It's just a mess.\n",
      "\n",
      "-- Instability.  I have to reset the device 2 - 3 times a day; it constantly hangs.\n",
      "\n",
      "-- The combination of the touch screen and the placement of too-sensitive volume keys on the side means that something unintentional is always happening on the screen (and with the phone).  Try to place this in a leather holster (or extract it), and odds are you'll have changed the volume while simultaneously having switched to one of the multi-layered screens several levels down.  It other words, pull this thing out of a belt clip or holster and you'll probably have to pull out the stylus and close a succession of two or three screens just to get back to the main \"Today\" screen (which is incredibly cluttered and counterintuitive).\n",
      "\n",
      "-- Battery life is pathetic.  Plan on having this plugged into a charger whenever possible.  With luck, you might make it through one day of use, IF you don't make or receive any phone calls but instead just use it to check your e-mail and calendar.  It's that bad.\n",

I switched to Verizon after 12+ years with AT&T/Cingular because of this phone and the EVDO network.  Now I am stuck with a $500 paperweight and a $175 cancellation fee to go back to Cingular.\n",

      "\n",
      "1 - the builtin Bluetooth sucks.\n",
      "\n",
      "It works and then it doesn't. Profile support is so limited on this device, I find it disgusting. Verizon (and I love Verizon by the way) is desperately trying to catch up in the Bluetooth arena. They sat on their arses for 2 years. Every other wireless service has excellent Bluetooth devices. If your a Verizon customer...like me...you will have to continue to be jealous.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 - The screen is smaller than the Treo650. A crappy resolution of 240x240. Other similar devices offer 320x320. Good luck getting your exisitng programs to display properly! They don't! I have 7 programs that WILL NOT display properly. Palm says they are working on this. GEEE! Thanks so much! Thanks for releasing a test model to the public. You get R&D at our expense!\n",
      "\n",
      "3 - No builtin WiFi. Need I say more? You'll have to spring for an expansion card. Ooops, there goes your storage!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "4 - Weak, slow and poor performing processor.\n",
      "\n",
      "5 - AND WORST OF ALL - NOT ENOUGH RAM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Whoever the geniuses were that decided the amount of RAM that would be available for this device should be dragged behind a car over broken glass until they die.

I had numerous crashes in my first week that reset the device so I had to reinstall some programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is one of those stories of how a phone could have been great! It is almost there. Trust me when I say you will be glad you waited for the next version of this phone. I have read in numerous magazines it is due in the spring. SURE! SURE!! after wearing for a few mintues, i got blister and swelling ears. it has no insulator. it hurt the back of the ears so bad and that when i notice i have blister. i don\"t know why motorolla  called themselve engineer. you don\"t need a rocket scientist to have some kind of pads or insulator to protect your skin According to the specifications this headset supports Bluetooth 1.2, as well as the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) and the Audio Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP). I could not get any sound to come out when connected with my Sony Ericsson w600i in phone or Walkman mode, and people could not hear me when I called them. I tried every setting possible, read the instructional booklets for each device and the thing still wouldn't to anything when connected. I am guessing that this headset works fantastically with any Motorola device, but as far as I'm concerned this product is guilty of false advertising. After this experience I do not plan on buying any Motorola Bluetooth devices. I upgraded from a Nokia 6600 (which I loved but it wasn't the hottest looking phone) and have also had the Motorola A630.  This phone is nice, dainty, and has a great display, but it ends there:\n",
      "\n",
      "*) The speaker isn't loud enough, so you're always pressing the phone to your ear so incredibly hard and still can't hear too well - I called T-Mobile, they acknowledged the problem and sent instructions to the phone to increase the speaker volume to no avail.\n",
      "\n",
      "*) The slider is hard to get to quickly - if you try sliding the phone open, many times you will actually reject a call.\n",
      "\n",
      "*) Using call waiting isn't too bad - when you go to call waiting it is easy, but retrieving a call is painful\n",
      "\n",
      "*) Text messages - this is the worst ever - first, slide the phone open, create a message, hit the enter key, then recent log, then select your recipients, then next then enter then the message sends.  On the nokia it was create the message, hit the green button, enter your destination, hit the green button.\n",
      "\n",
      "*) deleting messages is worse!  select the message, hit options, hit delete (sometimes it's 4, sometimes 6), \"are you sure\", hit yes, done.  On the nokia, select the message and hit \"c\" and you were instantly done.\n",
      "\n",
      "*) bluetooth - it's supposed to be convenient, but NO, you are always asked if you want to connect - there is no such thing as auto-connect!  every time I get in my car I have to get the phone out of my pocket and unlock the phone, then hit yes, or I'll be nagged every few seconds by a noise.  Oh, and if I hit NO (when someone else is in the car and I don't want calls going to the car) it'll ask me again in about 5 seconds.  ARRRGH!\n",
      "\n",
      "This baby is going back!  I'm now gonna try out the Blackberry 8700. Don't get me wrong the H3 looks good and sleek but it gives too much feed back. What I mean by that is that when your on the phone, the other party hears an echo.  This happend on all the calls. The only thing that kept me from returning it was that I lost the receipt and i threw away the box!  I don't recomend wasting your money on this. One you may try that has worked for me is the H500.  Cheap looks ok and best of all, it works!!!!  Oh yeah my Razor had a hard time linking to the H3. I've had to reinstall this software dozens of times. I finally figured out how to get it to work right. First off, you need to be connected to the internet as you install this. (Catch 22 if you planned on using your phone for that.) The main reason is so that you can update the software. I have a V3x which took several updates before it found the phone. (And I had to find the USB driver for my V3) In order to get it installed with vista, you might have to right click the moto desktop icon and \"run as admin\". After you get it working, you pretty much have to follow things in order when using the software. You have to plug the phone in, launch phone tools, use it, when done, close program, remove from PC. If you skip steps, esp if you're using he phone for internet, you run the risk of having to reinstall everything over again. Sometimes rebooting will help if it \"cant detect the phone\" after pulling the phone out before closing the program. Software is flakey, not user friendly but does work. Id bump the star up if I could but not over 3. The video and picture transfer and email writing features are good, but you can not browse the internet. This may or may not be a Windows XP problem, I don't know, but it really is a bummer that I can not get onto the internet. I have the Motorola Nextel i880 and the data cable would not fit. I returned this item immediately. IF YOU HAVE MOTOROLA NEXTEL PHONE STOP!!!THE USB CORD IS TO SMALL IT DOESN'T FIT AT ALL AND IT STATES IT CAN BE USED FOR ALL MOTOROLA PHONES.IT ONLY GETS A 1 STAR BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO RATE IT, I GIVE IT A BIG FAT O !!! Motorola should do better. This product would not install in ether of my state of the art computers.  Find a program from another source.  Save yourself some headaches. I'd like to say I was satisfied with this device, but I'm not, the ATT version for whatever reason was just SOOO much better than this phone on TracFone, and it was basically the same phone.\n",

      "I tried the strategy, and it works Bought this so I could use my GPS feature on my iPhone...worked well for the first day until I decided to move the mount to a different spot on my windshield.  The cheap plastic tab that locks the suction cup down broke like a weak twig.  Now the suction will not grip the window since I have no lever to lock it down.  If I could, I would have given no stars at all!  Very upsetting!!!! I never could get this to work right no matter what I did.  It wasn't even worth my time or money to send it back.  I was excited to try this on my mom's phone but it was more of a waste of time than it was worth. I feel foolish having even considered purchasing this item.  The price should've been my red flag but I still gave it a try.  A crutial piece of plastic broke off of it as soon as I plugged it into my phone and then remained there, thus creating a new project of removing it.  Most importantly, the cable doesn't work with Nokia phones, the company claims it does, but Nokia's drivers can't read it.  I fought with this thing for hours, then broke down and called Nokia only to find out that most third party cables are not compatable.  However, Nokia's representative was extremely knowledgable and helpful and that did reduce my frustration.  Thankfully I paid next-to-nothing for this product.  I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH THE USELESSNESS OF THIS ITEM. Absolute piece of junk. Check the warranty date, because this piece of junk is designed to break the day after the warranty runs out. I bought one from Nokia and it still works....5 years later. Go directly to Nokia and buy the real thing. Honestly, I have only had Cingular and T-mobile. I switched from Cingular because of the ridiculous surcharges and improper billing I was constantly faced with. After switching to T-mobile in July of 06 I can now say that I regret leaving Cingular. T-mobile has the worst reception I have ever seen. Almost anywhere I don't get service, someone with Cingular, Verizon, or Sprint does. I don't even get service in my own apartment with T-mobile and I am trapped in a contract with them until July 08. Once thats over though, I am gone for sure and I will NEVER return to T-mobile. Buyer beware, scams, cheats, and liars is all T-mobile is and ever will be. BTW when the phone I received with the contract broke (Samsung t809) they told me the phone was known for being defective and they had discontinued it, the only thing T-mobile was willing to replace my phone with was a RAZR. HA WOW THANKS! T-mobile is awful. I ordered the Blue Ant X5i from Shopcell - an Amazon market place vendor. While the product was delivered promptly enough, alas - it wouldn't even switch on.\n",
      "\n",
      " My first step was to call \"BLUEANT\" customer support (North America) . After a moderate wait I was able to get a live support rep. We went over diagnostics, but within the first minute of the call, his question was \"How much did you pay for this product?\"..When I answered $30 on Amazon.com - his response was \" Must have been refurbished! - send it back to the seller!!\"....When I mentioned the description says - brand new and it arrived in new packaging his answer didn't change.\n",
      "\n",
      " At this point - it became pretty obvious that he'd lost all interest in the call and wanted to just get me off the phone...\n",
      "\n",
      " Then I asked about their product warranty - I even have a product warranty card - he said, \"call the seller first or return it to them!\"....\n",
      " What kind or condescending product support/warranty is this - product support has no business asking about product price...\n",
      " I highly doubt their product warranty means anything to them or - or even if they will stand behind it.\n",
      "\n",
      " Their product support and brand standards are probably just like their product - substandard and indifferent I want to warn IT professionals that Verizon Wireless phone data email service is inappropriately spoofing sender's email address in messages sent from Motorola Q. This is creating problems with our anti-spam filters and I also believe this is unethical and should be illegal. We recommend against buying phones with this data/email service in our organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we configure our IMAP server option for the Motorola Q phone owned by one of our executives, the Verizon system is \"spoofing\" the email address as if the messages are being sent from our email server. These external but spoofed as internal messages get blocked by our anti-spam filters.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we wanted to try to \"white list\" (unblock) the Verizon servers on our anti-spam server, their technical support and Verizon representatives refused to give us the IP addresses of the servers from which email messages are being sent. This was probably refused by their network administrators for security concerns and I don't blame them for this. I'm sure they will agree with me that the problem should be instead resolved within Verizon's system software solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of spoofing a desired email address, messages coming from Verizon phones should have a distinct \"From\" and \"Reply-to\" addresses, with the first being any external Verizon wireless address, and the latter being the customer's desired and commonly used email address. The two must differ and only then the messages will not end up as spam because the sender won't be spoofed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Q seems like a good device, we advise against purchase and don't support their email integration in our organization until Verizon Wireless makes both \"From\" and \"Reply-to\" fields configurable. Small shops with Microsoft Exchange and loose anti-spam settings probably won't have problems like this. My wife had this phone for a few days, then all of a sudden, we couldn't get past the 'Verizon screen'!  The system completely 'froze up' to where nothing could get it to operate and perform calls or other functions for which it was made.  We took the phone back dissapointed.  Apparently, judging from other negative reviews online, Verizon is having some issues with some of these phones!  How they can release a product to market without extensive and relevant 'real world' testing is beyond me.  This reminds me of so many 'buggy' and problematic versions of Microsoft 'Windows' being released over the years that made one's computer crash, freeze, etc.!  Anyway, if Motorola perfects the 'MotoQ' in the future, we may look at it again. I previously owned a Nokia 6230 for nearly two years and was very happy with it. A month ago however the membrane beneath the keypad began malfunctioning and I decided it was time to move on. After spending some time researching and bargain-hunting, I settled on the D807 as a promising, and having found it for free after renewing my contract with Cingular here on Amazon, decided to take the plunge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well within a week the LCD has cracked, rendering the most impressive element of the phone useless. I am not a rookie when it comes to candy-bar style phones, and my Nokia made it through 18 months of the exact same treatment with no damage to the screen whatsoever. Thanks to neither Cingular nor Samsung willing to offer any kind of warranty I am stuck with a paperweight. I cannot recommend this phone despite its initial stylishness, and cannot offer any extensive reviews of its features because for all intents it is useless. I just received this phone as a replacement (from insurance) for my sony s710a and I could not be more disappointed with this phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The phone would not pair up with my jabra bt250v which I could possibly live without however with the phone being in my pocket I was unable to hear it ringing with the volume on 5 (the loudest it would go, also there are no \"profiles\" to possibly make it louder) The actual sliding portion did feel like it \"locked\" into place however the top portion of the phone felt very wobbly and cheap. The phone has no flash and you have to adjust the brightness for every photo which makes it useless if your kids are doing something that is a \"kodak-moment\". I didn't find the phone to be user-friendly out of the box, for instance factory default is when you dial a number and close the slide it hangs up the call. this can be disabled but it was a shocker the first time.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, go with the w600i sony phone (that's what the insurance company is going to be sending me as yet another replacement) I have about 4 of these 8300 over many years. I like it for a basic phone.  Unfortunately the replacement I bought on Amazon *(first time) had problems.  The zero key doesn't always work and this week the voice microphone went out so I can only use speaker.  Furthermore Verizon doesn't not send OS updates to the phone so the new phone is several version behind my older phone.  Very disappointing.  Oh and I don't see a warranty on the phone,. The soft phone concept is cool but to use this headset you have to make it your default audio device for mic and speakers.  This means your regular speakers can't be used at the same time and switching involves control panel, sounds, reset default, etc.  you're not going to have time to do this when a call is coming in.  If you leave your speakers as default (cuz you spent a lot of money on them and love to use them for music, etc.) you can still use this device as the mic only.... but then your callers hear themselves talking with you.  Platronics tech support says you can adjust the volumes to minimize this but the end result is never business quality.  So.... unless you are ready to give up use of your speakers this item is a piece of crap! I was excited when opening the box but only to find out the battery enclosed is of the wrong type for the cell.\n",
      "It simply does not fit. With quality control like this, I will think twice before buying anything from this vendor. Lasted no time at all the purchase went through dino direct via Amazon. I have had this bluetooth before and was satisfied..unfortunately these two never worked. Takes an act of God to find an english speaking cust service rep. I BOUGHT TWO JUST TO HAVE ONE CHARGING WHILE I USE THE OTHER ONE.\n",
      "BIG MISTAKE!!!  BOTH STOP CHARGING WITH NO REASONS\n",
      "IT WORKS OK JUST FOR A FEW MONTHS. Ordered this thing on Sep 19th.  It did not ship until Oct 26th!  And don't even get me started about the stupid reasons customer service gave as to why an In STOCK item took that long to ship.  Anyway, I finally got it.  I was so excited because of the great reviews I read.  When I saw the ear hook, I was like WHAT!  This is a flimsy piece of cr@p!  I thought to myself, \"This is going to break as soon as I use it, so I had better just leave it on.\"  Then to my utter AMAZEMENT!  YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT OFF TO CHARGE THE DUMB THING!  After the second charge, guess what?  IT BROKE!  Big surprise!  Now I have to hold the unit to my ear to use it, or if will fall out.  Not that the ear hook was all that great, the thing still fell off even when it had the ear hook.  I can't really comment about how well the thing works, because I can't keep it charged.  After the first complete charge, it died after one phone call.  It was about an hour phone call, but gee whiz!  This is my 5th bluetooth ear piece, so I have a little experience with these things.  My biggest complaint with the others was low speaker volume and noise interference.  I wish I would have had the chance to test this one out but it's going back to Amazon.  Maybe I should file an RMA and then wait a month and a half to ship it back to them. LOL! terribly uncomfortable and don't plan on using it in the car, all they will hear is the noise aroud you:( I've had this item for less then 1 month and the ear hoop/hook what ever has broken on me.  To charge the unit you have to remove this hook so the ear piece fits in it's charger box.  Yeah well 3rd time every charging it and the hook snaped right where it would hook onto the earpiece.  Seriously this thing is flawed and should just be avoided period.  Not to mention the autio qaulity is skiddish even with the phone litterly being right in front of me.\n",
      "I wish I never wasted my money on this ...it probably is. I would be well served to remember that before buying stuff next time. This thing was just so tiny I had to have it. And for the first 2 weeks it worked ok. Not great, just OK. Then the talk time began slipping... then the static began... then people started telling me they couldn't understand me. Then it stopped working completely. Less than 3 weeks old and already headed to the trash. What a waste.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've made up my mind: with bluetooth headphones, you get what you pay for. I'm going for a Jawbone 2, spending the extra cash on it, and I have no doubt in my mind it will be everything the reviews say it is. Enough Samsung garbage. Should have known. There are no other Samsung products in my home, and nor will there ever be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Matt Keeps flling off ear. does not work past 4 feet. Bought the Jabra 125 and love it I have owned the headset for over 2 months and the battery life is very very poor and it does fall out of the ear from time to time but i can deal with that and not the battery life, you will be lucky if it gives you an hour of talk time, do your self a favor and don't waste your money, yes it looks very sleek and nice but if i knew the battery life is this bad i would have never spend the money. First the headset wouldn't charge and the new set (the vendor was great and sent me another one) sound was so soft, no one could hear me (nor I they).  It really needed a better ear piece and/or a hook to hold it to the ear.  It fell twice out of my ear and I was afraid that I'd lose it. An above average headset for the price made totally non-functional by a ridiculous in-ear design. I totally agree with the other reviewers that couldn't keep this from falling out, even after considerable effort and experimentation.  Supposedly there is an optional ear loop that you can BUY from Samsung....should be included (and I couldn't find), but not sure how even that could work with the design.  I'll bet the next one is designed different and hopefully will also tweak-out the echo. That could be worth consideration  because the audio quality/size/price has potential. I've lost two bluetooth headsets because of this terribly designed case.  The only thing keeping the headset in is a tiny piece of very weak velcro. You may think its a steal getting a case for $3.00, but you better factor in the replacement cost of the headsets you will lose!!  AVOID!!!!!! This case is worthless with my Motorola HS815 headset.  Every time I put the headset in the case, the case squeezes the activation button on the headset.  Maybe it will work with headsets that do not have the activation button on the outside surface. I have the HS700 and this case (because it isn't rigid) constantly presses the button, putting the headset into discovery mode.  This should have been an aluminum hard case with room to keep that from happening.  You could also call that a design flaw in the headset, but either way you should get the combination of this case with that headset! These Motorola headphones are included in the V-Cast Music Essentials kit sold by Verizon and are worthless if you want to use them in anyplace that has any ambient noise. The earpieces are hyper-stylish flat discs with rather sharp edges that cannot seat in your ear at all (unless you have ear canals the size of dimes); they seat in your ear worse than iPod headphones, makiing it impossible to use them on, say, the bus. What they were thinking, I'll never know: using them in the car is illegal (both ears can't be covered) and they are useless for exercising: they fall out just sitting there, never mind trying to jog with them. Someone is going to make a mint making in-ear adapters; Motorola would be well advised to just offer a microphone/clip thing you can plug a pair of decent in-ears into in future. These are part of the V-Cast Music Essentials kit and are are worthless if you want to use them anyplace that has any ambient noise. They seat in your ear worse than iPod headphones, which makes it impossible to use them on, say, the bus. What they were thinking, I'll never know. Somone is going to make a mint making in-ear adapters; Motorola would be well advised to just offer a microphone/clip thing you can plug a pair of decent in-ears into.  In the mean time, save your money. It was supposed to fit my Motorola droid. Not without an adapter which it didn't bring. Too cheap to send back, out in the drawer may be someone will have use for it. Don`t Buy. Spend a little bit more if you want something that works well. Seriously, this item is of very poor quality. You will want to return it but it won`t be worth the hassle or the return postage. On the possitive side, the item arrived in just a few days. Like all other reviewers with the Krzr k1m phones said, this product does not work with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also bought a LG stereo headset for my daughter's LG Chocolate phone. I tried it with the 2.5mm plug adaptor (part # SYN1505A) that comes with the Krzr k1m phone, and the LG headset works great with the k1m. The headset has a volume control, a microphone and a button to answer the phone.  When the button is pushed to answer the phone, it pauses the music player.  After pushing the button again to end the call, the music player comes back.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, don't buy this for the k1m.  The LG headsets with the 2.5mm plug for the Chocolate works with the k1m.  I ordered another LG headset for my k1m. Received this item and tried plugging it into my K1m.  The K1m didn't even detect it was plugged in, and it never worked.  When I plug in the USB to 2.5mm adapter that came with the phone, the music player stops playing music on the speaker built into the phone, but with this headset plugged in, it just keeps playing from the built in speaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "After several emails back and forth with the seller, they finally informed me that there was a defect with the unit and they refunded my account.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am very disappointed that Motorola would produce a product of this poor quality.  Steer clear of this item. Dont be fooled. These headsets suck. My first pair broke out of the box and the 2nd pair work 65% of the time. It is NOT compatible with the KRZR K1m. I emailed the seller and was told that they are aware of this. They did refund my money, which was nice. But I still don't have headphones, which is not. It says for razr, krzr k1m, etc. but this is false. I contacted motorola about this product and they said it's NOT made for these phones and that I needed the 2.5 mm headset adapter (no microphone support) to use with my krzr k1m phone. My friend also tried to use it with his razr v3m. It failed there as well. Maybe it works with slvr or rokr, but if you have a razr or krzr, save your time and money. very big and uncomfortable!! I used to have a Motorola H500 which worked well for my phone. Unfortunately I misplaced it. So I eventually bought another one via Amazon. When I got it, it worked but had a hissing and crackle sound. I thought it was my phone and the problem would eventually go away. It did not. This was suppose to be a brand new headset. It's defective and I did not return it immediately. So I'm giving this supplier a 1 star. It acted as thought it was muted when it wasn't. I tried it on two separate cell phones and it did the same thing on both phones. The person being called could hear the first syllable and that was it. I did try to turn the mute off, all it did was change the frequency of the buzzing sound the other person heard. While I will agree that the device works as advertised and the sound quality is pretty decent this headset has caused me more heartache in annoyances to outweigh any benefit.  If you buy this be prepared for the device to turn on and off at very in opportune times.....  but if you want to turn it off, thats a whole different story.  Powering the device on and off requires holding the button down for a certain period of time but the problem is that the time required seems to change each time you do it.  Add to this that holding the button down for a period of time shorter than the period of time required to turn it off is actually a redial function.  I have FREQUENTLY called someone just by trying to turn off the device.  The button is also entirely too sensitive.  I've had the device in my cargo pants pocket (where this would be very little pressure on the device) and the unit has turned on and actually called someone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other issues are the charging indication isn't real clear and there isn't any idea of knowing how charged the battery is and the device isn't quite as comfortable as other devices that I have used (its bearable but there is definately more comfortable for the money). Call me native but I did not expect for it to cause the phone to heat up so much. After, about 10 minutes of phone activity the phone was noticeably hotter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cutout for the micro-usb was a little small to solidly connect the Samsung OEM usb cable. It needs a small amount of trimming so the cable can sit flush against the phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, for the price being charged I knew I couldn't expect much. Coming for an Otterbox Defender case for my other phone, the DuoSuit provides on the minimumal protection against bumps and low-level drops. But considering the Galaxy Note is such a large, thin phone I will be surprised if any cases will be able to provide adequate protection. I purchased this for my wife and she did not like it. She said that it was cheap looking and that the pouch would not stay on her pants unless she was wearing a belt. First off, this does not even warrant ONE STAR.  This phone is absolute trash. It might look great but in reality it is a users nightmare.  The phone's biggest problem is the 'touch' buttons on the front. Adjusting the sensitivity will not solve the problem. Picking up the phone and placing it to your ear is liable to cause any number of annoying pushes on the keypad.  You might mute the call, hang up, or who knows what else.  Like other users, the cool factor wore off in about 3 days when I realized what I was in for.  Now, many months later, if you just touch the call button ONE TIME it starts calling the last person on your list.  Put the phone in your pocket? FORGET ABOUT IT! The phone will dial at random.....it should come with extra minutes from VZ because you will sure enough burn through them with all the 'accidental' calls.  It's ridiculous to have to treat this phone like this so that you don't accidentally dial a call. It is by far, the worst phone I've ever used.  I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. If you've recently bought the phone and are still within the return window, RETURN IT! My new phone doesn't have a headphone port so I had to finally go bluetooth.  I bought this because it was rated so high but so far it has been a big disappointment.  When I'm in the car I constantly had people telling me they couldn't hear me or I was cutting out.  I have pretty much junked it which is sad because now I'm using the handset. Although I did not purchase this bluetooth headset from Amazon (used a local cellular retailer), I felt compelled to write a review just to warn others that this product is not worth buying.  Here are my complaints:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Gel ear buds DO NOT STAY ON (now I've lost all of them), and neither does the over-ear hook.\n",
      "(2) Headset does not stay in, regardless of earbud chosen or whether or not I used the over-ear hook.\n",
      "(3) Does not stay charged through one long phone call.\n",
      "(4) People on the \"other end\" complained of a lot of noise and echo (no noise cancelling technology, apparently).\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, my BIGGEST complaint is that this thing constantly comes apart.  I've had it sort of settled in my ear and, while talking and sitting still, the earbud or hook will fall off and the headset drops to the floor.  I find this product extremely frustrating, and I'm sorry I bought it and kept it too long to return it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't waste your time and money! I had this headset for about 2 months and I was glad someone actually stoled it from my car one day that I forgot to lock my car doors..\n",
      "\n",
      "The reception was ok only when withing 5 ft away, and only when there was nothing blocking in-between..  It was one of the most secure bluetooth headsets I have ever had until then, but at a very painful price to pay.  Majority of the time, the disconfort and pain goes away or you just get used to it, but not with this headset, is design in such a way that the only way you can ensure it stays firm in your ear is my angleing it just right, meaning the ear piece that goes into your canal will be pushing very hard against it..\n",
      "\n",
      "As for voice quality, is just ok and as mention before, make sure nothing is blocking the signal because you will get static.  Some times when you move around the static comes and goes, but at times there is static no matter if you are close to the phone or not..  My guess is that it has to do with the fact that it's only a VT version 1.1 & 1.2 and those versions have always have static to be normal no matter who makes them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have always expect great products from Plantronics, but not this time.. I really don't have a lot of time. That is why I shop online, So if I'm purchasing an item that is to be used to make life more convenient, like a Bluetooth headset, it really is obnoxious to receive one that is \"worse than sucks\". This item did not even charge. Plantronics really needs to pull this item because it is really damaging to their reputation to have this out there for sale. I choose Plantronics because as a Regional Sales Manager/Road Warrior, I've always had luck with Plantronics. Too bad that this one was a lemon. This product is junk. Had it less than a month and it stopped working. Dont waste your money. Received headset Dead on Arrival. Was told to ship back for replacement. Shipped back at my expense and was then informed a week later that it was discontinued and I was refunded the price less shipping. So I'm out $12 in shipping for the joy of holding this nice looking piece if junk.\n",

It is a cheap clear piece of plastic and was not for a Samsung galaxy2. It was twice the size of my phone.

Clip broke the 1st day I received this on the 7th, it broke on the 10th. I didn't hit it on anything or catch it on anything. Stay away from this it is cheaply made garbage. well i got the BoxWave Holster and i went to use it for the First Time TODAY and it has a crack on the side of it i want a Replace ment can you please send me the replace ment for it ( The Belt clip side of the case has the crack on it ) Slim case! The belt clip/kick stand broke 2 days into use. Small bumps cause it to fall off the belt clip until it finally just breaks. It suppresses vocals but not completely. On some songs it suppresses upto 80% but on most of the songs its not even 25%. It feels as if it dims the vocals and amplifies the music a little bit but this product is USELESS to be used for karaoke. The worst part is I can't even return it. I already paid 4.99 for shipping and I will have to pay pretty much the same amount to return it. Junk. Must be very old stock and not charging at all. Battery did not work. Would not buy again. The battery does not charge the phone properly. I t takes like 5 hours to charge. The cell phone drops the battery charge after one hour of use. The battery is very weak.\n",

Probably not a relevant review today, but still not worth your money This is the second one they sent me, both are complete trash. After 1 or 2 charge cycles it dies within 5 minutes when fully charged. DO NOT BUY I bought two, but they sent three; took 4 weeks to get in mail, as they'd warned when purchasing; wrapped up to look like OEM, but I'm thinking it's a fake; people selling it certainly haven't responded to my complaints;  works no longer than my 4 and 6 year old OEM batteries scavenged from other folks dead Moto V3 RAZRs.  Wish I could give them NO STARS on this one. I bought this brand new battery for a used Unlocked Motorola Razor. The phone was going to be a gift for a relative overseas. The battery is DOA. I charged it first thinking the battery was drained. Four hours later the phone wouldn't power up. I put in the old battery and voila everything is working. I just wasted $5 and four hours of agony. Why would a seller bother to ship a battery that is dead without testing it. Don't buy from this seller folks. I received the battery and charged it before use for 24 hours. I put it in my phone and it lasted about 1 hour. I called the vendor for a replacement and after a very long conversation they agreed to send a replacement. Then I received the wrong battery. Called, they said they would replace it but after 2 weeks I just filed for a refund. I won't order online again.\n",

Too bad.. it looked super awesome on the iphone :( I was expecting an original version of Motorola RAZR but  got a duplicated version which stop functioning after the 1st use as well as it refused charging.

Sorry amazon, this is my first dissapointed review at amazon. there are 2 d&g as anne said, black and gold which is the limited edition one and the mass production one, i just bought this one but unfortunately its not in a perfect or new condition some dirt on it, the color is faded and is almost gone from the side buttons, doesnt close welland a white label inside the body trying to cover the original fone information, the assemblying is very poor, i love motorola, never had this problem, please be aware of thi, i think it's refabrished or something, missing features, buttom line DONT BUY IT FROM HERE i would sell mine for 10$ without shipping however i just got today.:S I wanted to use rechargeables (good performance and inexpensive) and keep this in my briefcase as a backup charger.\n",

This item's description, in my opinion, is outdated and should be updated not only with similar verbiage but as well a picture of the connectors that are included, i.e., the back of the product packaging where they allow the buyer to try connecting their phone to and of three included connectors.

Worst item I've ever purchased.  Brand new batteries wont' even fully charge my phone once.  Don't buy it.  The regular stores have stopped carrying it because it keeps getting returned because it doesn't work worth a darn. I ordered this product previously from this seller and I liked it.  After about a year of use, it was starting to show wear.  I ordered a replacement and it is not as listed.  The item pictured is not what you receive.  The cut outs for your charger, etc. are not in the places as shown in the picture...the one shipped is not even the CELLET brand as it had been previously.  Further, the seller offers a 'Hassle-Free Returns Policy' as long as the item is defective.  I suggest you look for the same item from another seller. It came fast and undamaged but its a terrible fit. Atleast for the Samsung Sliders and sony ericsson Walkman phones. Maybe it will fit your phone but did not fit mine. I needed bluetooth headphones to use with my computer, but this wasn't the one. Nice looking headphones, I like them a lot but can't get them to work even with some hints from Motorola. They connect with the computer but this is a far as we managed...With wire they work fine, but that's not the idea... Thanks VZ u messed up AGAIN!!!!!!! They mess up another signature phone with VZ's nasty user interface. Everbody hates the MENU style SO PLEASE STOP making every new phone have the same MENU STYLE!!!!!! nobody wants it!!!!!!! When will VZ ever get it RIGHT!!!!!!??????? Had to return it. Could not change the language from Chinese to English. I needed a cheap phone to tide me over till my contract expires. I've always had good luck with Motorola products previously, but i suspect the mouthpiece on the phone i got is defective.

You may be able to stand it, but there are many other phones work better.\n",
      "my conclusion is, its appearance is cool but not durable. This charger was one of the cheapest, but wasn't worth the savings.  In less than a month the product stopped working and upon examination it was clearly fried!  Even the outer plastic looked as though it was melting.  Definitely not worth it. I bought the protectors because I liked the thought of the mirror. But Was very disappointed. The protector scratches very easily and looks unattractive. U need a protector to protect the protector. The original version of this great Nokia phone was really cool.  Big display, email, fast internet.

      "1. A phone that is acceptible, not exceptional, for making calls.  If that's all you want, get something cheaper.  The good news is this phone seems to have dropped in price like a rock, so maybe you can buy it for what it is actually worth.\n",

      "2. A 1-megapixel camera, which is almost pointless because the only way to send pictures is with picture messaging, which will resize the pictures down to the same resolution as it does for any phone.  No installing email applications, remember?\n",

      "\"The 6133 is a mobile messaging and Internet powerhouse.\"?  Um, no. I purchased this phone through AT&T and it has been nothing but a headache. After receiving it, the Sync worked for several hours, then, abruptly, it could neither receive nor make calls.\n",
      "I took it to an AT&T store and they explained to me that the Sync sometimes has problems recognizing sim cards. They installed a new one. Again, it worked for several hours and then stopped being able to make or receive calls.\n",
      "When it did work, the sound quality was awful.\n",
      "It does have a beautiful display...big deal.\n",

You will start the day thinking you have several hours of talking left, and will find yourself at zero power after a 15 minute call. Carry a spare battery and / or charger to avoid frustrating and inconvenient downtime, or better yet get a more efficient phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another big problem with this phone is the music player feature. Unless you plan on purchasing an expensive media plan from your carrier, all the connectivity features of this phone are pointless. Downloading stuff by the kb is insanely costly, and the media plans add significant cost to the monthly plans. Also, to transfer music from your PC to this phone by USB is agonizing, as the phone takes more than half an hour to transfer a single CD (10 songs). To put a lot of music on this phone takes inhuman patience, and then you have to use junky Samsung proprietary earphones to listen to your tunes as no headphone adaptor jack is available.\n",

      "On the positive side, MP3 playback through the Sync speakers sounds surprisingly good. The signal strength is usually very good, a pleasant step up from older Samsung designs, as good or better than Nokias, a big achievement for Samsung. Call quality and speakerphone performance is also very good. Camera takes good pics, but only has a 2X zoom on 1.3 MP and no zoom at all on the 2.0 MP setting. Samsung has much better camera features on some of its other models. The phone does look nice and it is pretty durable and well-built.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line: if you want a phone to make calls on, the A707 Sync has good call quality and excellent signal strength. However, the rotten battery life and rapid non-geometric decrease in battery life makes this phone unreliable and irritating to use for its primary purpose. If you add silly junk to your usage like watching videos and browsing the web, you will only decrease the battery life and make the phone even less useful as an actual telephone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The true Achilles heels to all these multimedia phones are the added cost to users for subscription plans, and the limitations of current portable device battery life. The Sync makes you acutely aware of both of these problems. Until better batteries are available, Samsung should not build phones this inefficient, or at the very least should not call them \"wireless\". You don't need a phone line attached to these, but you will need a power cord! the battery on this phone is terrible...evewryday i'm charging it, and the reception is very poor.....i miss my nokia If I have to buy an extra speaker to be able to hear OnStar instead of it going through the factory speakers this thing is pointless. this item is defective and missing parts,is not as describe in the web,is something no right because no complete pieces The recommendation that everyone else was buying this didn't work.  It could not have fit the portable scanner..... I purchased this because it was recommended with the scanner I was ordering - scanner doess not fit and there is no provision for cord storage Did not fit any of my phone screens.

Ended up buying a differnt model for 25 bucks that connects to your cd player slot and that one is amazing. Terrible quality, didn't fit my vents securely. Flopped around when driving..tried to take it off and it broke. Waste of money. I wasn't expecting much for the price but at least that it holds my iphone, and it barely squeezes in with a good amount of force, I have a very slim skin cover. Not worth returning but disappointing. The sticky dash mount broke as I tried to remove it, one of the arms shortly afterwards.  Also, it comes with no instructions, have to guess at orientation from the pictures. I bought this for $6.90 with shipping of $.99 included. I got what a paid for, a piece of junk. I should have saved that money for a Togo's sandwich instead. Not only the damn thing broke a piece of my vent, it didn't work. No matter how I adjusted it, I couldn't get my phone from facing the sky, which is contracting to what was being depicted on the website. As for the sticky stand, don't use that. You will crack your phone as everything will end up on the floor. I can not return this because it would cost me almost half of what I paid for it. The seller refused to pay for a return label. Don't be fool. Don't buy this piece of crap. I buyed this item, i don't recomended, because,after feww days use, the stickers does`nt work, and you can hold the phone, not good.

HAVE NOT SEEN ANY INCREASE IN BAR STRENGTH.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE. Had zero effect. My windows must already allow enough signal through for this to not make a difference. Bought it for the back of my place because I get full bars right outside on the patio, and almost none inside (I live in a concrete apartment). If I put the phone in the same place I had this, I get good reception, but this didn't extend my signal any, or act as a repeater. Didn't seem to help in the car either, but I don't really need it there. There are a few spots around town where my calls get dropped when I use my cellular phone while driving in the car.  These areas are very small, only about 300 feet long.  And if I hold the phone outside the car when I drive through these areas, the calls don't drop.\n",

      "This device is a total waste Mobile service providers claim that this type of antenna does not work, and I have to agree with them.  Installing it actually reduced my reception from 2 bars to NO bars!  If you search the internet, you will find that passive antennas like this are no different than that battery compartment sticker that claimed to improve cell phone reception, block radio waves from frying your brain, etc.  It doesn't work and it's a waste of money.\n",

My 4S fits terribly in there.  Wish I hadn't bought. We're too attached!!! Get a little mp3 player for $29.99 instead of trying to pack around your stupid iPhone! Leave it home during your workout! Holster does not hold phone securely. It's cute but no protection at all. Broke my holster to my outterbox, so I thought I'd switch up and just when I did, my phone broke away fell and my screen cracked.....no good I have been searching high and low for a quality case for my note 2. This case seems flimsy and the design just dose not impress me. May be a personal thing however I discontinued use after one day. Phone keep falling out the case. It looks good but works terrible. Cannot hang on side of pants because of this Cheep, thin phone will fall out.  Not satified. Cool idea but needs improvement for more secure holding. You have to be really careful not to turn it upsidedown Don't buy this cheap ugly product! Worst mistake in buying a case for my phone. EEW! Never Again! NO! NO! Not a good product. The main reason for my purchase was to use the kickstand. However, the kickstand is very difficult to operate. It cannot be opened very easily and is not a comfortable accessory. The customer service from Boxwave is horrible. They made a bad product and instead of an easy return they wanted me to pay the return shipping. Thanks to Amazon customer service for their A to Z guarantee and reimbursing my money. So in a nutshell, I would not advise buying this case. LOOKS GREAT FITS INTO THE DOCK JUST FINE AFTER YOU PULL OUT THE SLEVE. BUT WITH IT ON THE PHONE YOU LOOSE ONE-TWO POWER BARS OR ON-TWO WIFI RINGS. TAKE IT OFF AND THEY'RE BACK. The plug won't even fit into the back of my LG TV.  The diameter of the outer ground ring is too large to fit.  I'm sure the TV plugs are standard, so this cable obviously isn't.  Very disappointed that we couldn't even try it out because it won't fit. Garbage keeps cutting out and I have to shove it and move it around to get the picture back :( Terrible, lots of static lines running across the screen. Exactly as described.  Worked out of the Box and met my expectations.  Would recommend to friends and family for sure. When I received this cable I immediately plugged it into my flatscreen TV. Absolutely no video whatsoever. Worked with a number of settings trying to get the TV to work with the video input. Definitely a waste of $10, and I will not be purchasing anything from this company ever again. I agree with some of the reviewers that a lot of the reviews with three stars or more must be from the owner of the company. When buying products from Amazon checkout the dates for the reviews because some of these reviews have to be bogus. Thought itd be worthwhile to upgrade cables, but I don't see a difference. Not a positive one anyways. I have this hooked into a nice 47\" 120hz Vizio and I see no better screen than I got from the standard cables with the Wii set to widescreen. The Wii isn't capable of better than 480, so don't expect miracles. I couldn't see any difference between this and the original cable.  I checked it out for both, playing Wii games (RE4) and watching movies via Netflix and I can't tell any difference...complete waste of money vs. the original cable. i plugged it in and image has noise. I used the regular video cable that came with the WII and all is fine. You will have to return it so don't waste your time. Cables did not work at all.  Tried it on 3 different setups.  Just plain don't work.  I was forced to give it one star in order to publish this review, but it gets zero stars. I paid for this and after three weeks had not received anything; no communication or product.  Finally the seller sent me an email that they would be crediting my credit card because they were out of stock.  Gee, they did not have any problem accepting my money three weeks prior.  I never did receive the product. One of the most important pieces of information when your buying a cable is the LENGTH!!! Hello handhelditems and/or Amazon. List the length! Now I have to buy another dang cable because not only was the length not listed I was in to much of hurry to buy a DIFFERENT cable! Had I not been in a hurry I would not have bought it. There is no length listed!!\n",

When they wonder why there dang cable isn't selling maybe they'll learn to slow down and display the IMPORTANT information!! the phone would slip out of holster my phone fell out a couple of times and it fell to the ground a couple of times The case arrived and was immediately applied to the Galaxy S4.  Upon clipping to the belt, the clip broke.  We had not even owned it for 15 minutes, and it is useless. It serves it's purpose, but I guess it could have been better. here are my pros and cons\n",

      "It shakes too much when you are driving.\n",
      "To release iphone, you have squeeze the sides and press the button in the back.\n",

      "I tossed it in to garbage for the cons I mentioned in my original review. When I first got this mount I was pretty happy with it. Unfortunately it did not last. About 6 months after I got it there were problems, and within 9 months it was in the garbage. The problem is that the months these nice little arms on the sides that slid in and out on gears so that it can accommodate devices of various sizes. While this is good in theory, the gears are plastic, and wore out. At first it started getting stuck open or closed. After a while it stripped the gears and the arms became frozen in place. No amount of work was able to make it work again, and into the garbage it went. I would not buy this again. Pile of junk>>Did not fit>> .88cents was too much to pay for it\n",
      "Trashed it not durable, side buttons are very hard to press, kickstand is flimsy and broke first day. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!! the button access for VOL and PWR is impossible with this case. I returned it and got a spigen which is great. Did not even stick for one full day. The item was not as described. It failed to mention that the battery needed to be replaced. Even after it was charged for hours and became fully charged,  it died after 5 minutes of being on. This indicates an old/defective battery, so now I have no use for the GPS. This unit isn't three pieces its one piece and doest even cover the front of the unit.  I am sending it back. It looked great for my Motorola Android. One thing I was a little hesitant about when I ordered it was the fit. Did some one take the time to measure this thing well? No they didn't is too tight and too dense. By the phone going in too tight is difficult to pull out but more difficult is feeling the vibrations(I don't) or hearing the ringing (I don't ). Too tight also means having difficulty pulling it out to call being that I can't get the phone call from it since I don't know when someone rings. Another well photograph product from \"China\" other wise a piece of junk. It is advertised for the Droid RAZR, but really is for the Droid X. Not a good fit at all. Cellet is garbage.  I had two of their brand cases and both broke soon after buying them.  They claim leather but it is really faux leather aka. plastic and its faux leather is the thickness of a dollar store Condom. I have read some positive and some negative on these. I bought four to test on different phones and to test two on one phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rather than type a lot of detail, I'll simply say, these did absolutely nothing. If I had one bar before, I had one bar after. Two bars before, two after. Zero? Definitely zero after. This was true on a Dash, RAZR, and Samsung T629. Style, make or model did not matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Contrary to what I have seen some say, putting two on a phone made no difference. New phones use hd signal. Didnt work at all, Did nothing for my phone.. made no difference on my phone Waist of money.. Snake Oil Im being censored by Amazon for telling the truth about this item, im not allowed to leave an honest review? Don't buy I agree with all the other reviewers here.  This was a waste of money.  After installing it on my phone, there was no change in the service.  There's a dead zone that almost drops our calls when we go through there.  Well, having the antenna booster on my phone didn't change that. I tried to use this and for the first hour it stayed in place but 5 minutes after the hour was up it fell right out. I wouldn't recommend this at all. I will just have to wait until I can afford to get my filling filled. Great for holding your wireless pack to your strap. I go through one of these about every 2 years because the hook and loop material starts to pull apart and the faux leather backing on the hold down strap starts to fall apart. But for the price I'll keep picking one up. Or until I find something better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: the most recent one I purchased started to fall apart after a couple of months. The hook and loop is barely useable and the faux leather backing is already gone. Dont bother. It creates so much interference with the radio, that almost all signal is lost. I bought this a couple of months ago and it already quit working. It felt heavy duty when I first got it and thought it would be great to power my iPhone. It burnt out and i took it apart. When i got it apart i found lead weights hot glued into it to make it feel heavy. Too funny that Chinese ingenuity. The part is junk. If mounted anywhere near your radio, which is often the case, it will completely kill your reception, FM or AM.  Even with nothing plugged into it.  Makes this worthless to me.  Avoid.\n",

      "They need to better shield this! Got the product, plugged it into my car, everything worked.  Good news so far.  The second time I used it, the USB ports didn't work.  Maybe I blew a fuse on it, except the 12 V sockets were working.  Just a defect in the USB ports.  I got a refund, so the seller was great about it.  And I know manufacturing is never 100% perfect, but I wasn't willing to try again.  Bought something else. I bought the unit to add bluetooth to my car stereo. the unit shows up and only has a 6 foot cable on it.  Great if you want the cable dangling across the windshield, junk if you want to actually install the unit in the car with no wires showing.\n",

Did not work with our galaxy 4 phone! It only works with some networks. I did not see that before ordering. Beware! This product looks nice and works fairly well out of the box. Water pressure is poor if that is important to you. It is impossible to keep the head clean with all those little heads and the space in between. I am a clean freak and I hate mold & mildew in the bathroom. This material & design allows mold & mildew to grow rampant. The water pressure only gets worse & worse. I purchased it for my husbands Birthday in June but the actual purchase was 6 months earlier. It did not go into use until June but they won't take that into account when considering the warranty. Now the arm refuses to stay in place. It is pointing down & refuses to stay up anymore. Of course we had to replace it, Again! I really hated this cheap shower head.\n",

The headset was purchased to pair with the new Storm, it was terrible, muffled on the called side and sounded like a tunnel on the caller side.

      " My first step was to call \"BLUEANT\" customer support (North America) . After a moderate wait I was able to get a live support rep. We went over diagnostics, but within the first minute of the call, his question was \"How much did you pay for this product?\"..When I answered $30 on Amazon.com - his response was \" Must have been refurbished! - send it back to the seller!!\"....When I mentioned the description says - brand new and it arrived in new packaging his answer didn't change.\n",
      "\n",
      " At this point - it became pretty obvious that he'd lost all interest in the call and wanted to just get me off the phone...\n",
      "\n",
      " Then I asked about their product warranty - I even have a product warranty card - he said, \"call the seller first or return it to them!\"....\n",

      " Their product support and brand standards are probably just like their product - substandard and indifferent I purchased this product based on a CNET recommendation.  CNET has been a reliable source for most of my technology purchases.  This however, was a disappointment.  The unit does not eliminate sound effectively, volume controls are \"mushy,\" the microphone/on off switch will not stay retracted, resulting in a constantly discharging battery.  It did pair easily, and the voice activated controls worked well.  I would not purchase another, and would advise others to avoid this model. I purchased this after reading the positive reviews.  I should have paid more attention to some of the negative reviews that talked about the microphone wand that acts as an on/off switch.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I am disappointed that Amazon does not clearly explain what to do with products that go defective after a month. I never even bought this I didn't like it as they must of been seconds as the backs ripped out right away and I can't use them and I guess that's why they were so cheap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't buy It. I have been wearing it one month and already de area of the belt is cracked. I liked the shape, model, for my S4 with zerolemon super battery. but as I said don't last if you use it each day. I was looking for a casual phone case for my new Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone that would take a certain level of abuse during use. The case stated it would fit my phone.  It didn't.... With the phone in the case, the lid would not close.  I decided not to return it for the cost and gave it to a friend who has a smaller phone (it fit that phone). I bought this case despite some negative reviews due to needing stuff ASAP as Sprint was shipping me my new S4 and i dread not having everything i need right away..I am using this case for a Samsung S4 with a Hyperion Samsung Galaxy S4 5200mAh Extended Battery + Black Back Cover (Compatible With ALL Samsung Galaxy S 4 Models) [18 Month Warranty] **NOW WITH NFC / Google Wallet** and the Hyperion Samsung Galaxy S4 Extended Battery HoneyComb Matte TPU Case / Cover  for the enlarged battery and Door. This case performed great for 2 weeks, then the GLUE just stopped holding the seams together for all stress points on the case. I bought mine from  DeCi Accessories. I cannot recommend this case. Upon plugging into any USB port on my computer and plugging into the charging port on my E71, the phone at first recognizes the charger and plays the charging tone. But then, within seconds, the phone disconnects from \"charge mode\" and displays an error message (something like \"charger not recognized\").\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought I researched this product enough beforehand to be reassured it would work with my E71 and it hasn't worked once yet... I'm very disappointed. I thought I'd be able to get rid of the AC charger, and gain the use of a USB charger while traveling, but no such luck. I've tried several of these cell phone signal boosters, and I have to say, not one of them is worth a dime.  Do they boost your cell signal?  Maybe...a little....sort of... not really.  Yes, the bars on my Sprint phone do jump a tad when I turn this on, but it's barely noticeable and certainly not worth the exorbitant price.  This one just feels like tech snake-oil.  No, moving to different locations made no difference.  Nothing did.  This thing is just a placebo.  Don't bother. The unit I received contained no instructions; no problem go online to company site to get them.  Easy to install put the unit near window or anywhere you have service (at least one bar) then put the antenna at least ten feet away.  The antenna cable is only 20' so it is difficult to go further than that unless you are going to have cable in front of you, then the next problem is that you can not have the cell phone near the unit so in my 15' x 12' office I could not move the unit and antenna around so that I could get a green light as you also have to have phone within 6' of antenna.  Gave up after an hour of moving all over only to get a green light for a few moments then back to red.  Did nothing to improve signal since I could not get a green light, presumably this would have indicated that I have a signal that my cell phone then would pickup.  I may try the other four person Sprint device the company has? First of all, the YX3000 performs as described.  I have been using it in an office building where my cell phone reception is blocked by a steel structual support column.  By placing the base unit in a window and routing the antenna wire around the structual column and placing the antenna near my desk, my reception improved by 3 to 4 bars.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first unit failed just short of two months.  The indicator light would quickly flash alternating green and red for a couple of seconds, then shut down.  Unplugging the unit and plugging it back in got the same response.  The zBoost customer service people were very nice and easy to reach on the phone and they set up a RMA to return and replace the YX300 with a brand new unit.  With ground shipping both ways the turn around was about two weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new unit functioned for about two weeks and then went bad just like the first unit.  Again, their customer service folks were very nice and are setting up another RMA replacement.  This time I insisted that I should not have to pay shipping for shipping my unit back to them and they agreed.  I don't have much confidence that the third unit will last very long, either.  I'm keeping track of my warranty claims, from the time I make the claim to the time I receive a replacement, because the manufacturer must add that lost time back on to the warranty period.  It is illegal (at least in California) for a manufacturer to run down the consumer's warranty clock while warranty claims are pending (as long as the delay is not on the consumer's end).  The 1-year warranty is one year of usability by the consumer and not just one calendar year from purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bottom line is that this product does work--when it works at all.  If there was a comparable product on the market I would switch to it in a heartbeat.  But functionally competitive products require wired access to the outdoors, which for most people is not practical at work. This device did absolutly nothing to help my reception.  I tried it in a dozen locations in the house with several phones.  I have VERIZON and usually have good service, but not in the house.  The device blinks red when the antenna is too close to the booster.  In several cases, I had the antenna as far away from the booster as the booster plug and the antenna line would allow, still blinking red.  When I did get a green light, there was no change in my one or two bar signal on any phone.  Useless machine. This booster works really great on the rare occasions it actually works at all. It has a red light which is supposed to indicate that the antenna is too close to the box. I have the antenna as far away from the box as the wire permits, and when I turn the box on, the light shows green and the device works great... for about 15 minutes or so. Then the red light comes on for no apparent reason, and the device has to be unplugged and plugged in again to make it work again. So, this makes it pretty useless, because unless I just happened to plug the device in minutes before someone calls me, it won't be working. This product advertises amazing results, but does not perform as described. I purchased this product to boost the signal in my office at work because my office building is in a somewhat remote suburb. I did not see any improvement in the strength or consistency of my signal after a few days of continuous use. I was not hoping for miracles, but was at least hoping to see some improvements. I will continue looking for alternatives, as I was not at all satisfied with this product and I have since returned it. I thought this would work with micro usb, but the photo is of a mini usb. And the carton says to go to a website that is now offline. I say return it even if you destroy the package. They make the package impossible to open so it will determine you from returning it. I say send it back in pieces. The product worked for about a week but then it just stopped working.  didn't really charge anything.  Too cheep.  Buy better quality! This is a piece of junk.  This is a waste of money.  This is not worth buying.  Look elsewhere.  Junk. my phone fell on a soft surface and this little gadget broke my screen even though my phone was in a case and had a glass protector... Well I love the RAZR, if it was genuine. I think this was a fake one. i have t-mobile & ordered this phone (i live in northern california) & when i made phone calls, i heard a lot of back ground static. don't know if the phone was defective or what, but it was no good for me. i returned it. As have many of the others reviewed here  my clip broke after 3 weeks so don't waste you money on this one, The Samsung WEP210 may be the worst bluetooth I've tried.  You can barely hear the caller.  It doesn't want to stay in the ear at all.  Most importantly, the call quality was terrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "I deffinately DO NOT recommend this device. Maybe I was a bit harsh in the title, but I had to put something out there that would grab  your attention.  I want to save you the trouble that none of these other reviews did for myself.  Most of the reviews were great so I bought it.  I have to say the sound is pretty decent, very similar if not slightly worse than my wep200.  The wep410 looks very stylish, but it just doesn't FIT RIGHT IN THE EAR.  It feels like it is going to fall out and it doesn't sit at the angle where it is pointing from your ear to your cheek, which is what the wep200 does.  When it sits at the angle it is NOTICEABLY flaring outwards.  It looks like it is sticking out of your cheek at a 30-40 Degree angle, which looks extremely odd.  I tried all three different sized earbuds, but no luck with any of them.  I can get it to fit in my ear, but the fit of the earbuds is VERY poor.  I even got my father to try this headset to see if I had deformed ear canals, but they also didn't fit him right.  I really wish I could return this, but since I have opened it I can't.  Sadly, I had to give the headset to my father.  (He doesn't care how poor the fit is as long as he can use it for hands free calling in the car)\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line is that you SHOULD NOT buy this headset, but you should buy the Samsung Wep200.  That Headset is excellent for the price and very light in weight  That headset is also the one you want if you like ear buds like myself.  I don't like big bulky \"Android\" looking Blue tooth sets that take up a bunch of room. I just got my jawbone today but before I start to use it, I am already unsatisfied with following reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The crescent hole of  the USB connector doesn't attach to jawbone securely! The headset keeps disconnecting from the charge cable. So it can't steadily stay in charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The length for the earbud is not long enough to stay inside the ear, and another reason for this is because the back of Noise Shield area is so thick that somehow not allow your earbud insert deeper to your ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. With earloop installed, it's so hard to wear the jawbone even I've tried other sizes came with box.\n",
      "(There are 4 earloops they provide, 2 sizes \"standard\" & \"long\" for left & right side)\n",
      "\n",
      "Basically I haven't started to try the sound quality but honestly, I felt very disappointed with this due to the reasons above.(The charge connector keeps disconnect from jawbone while I am writing my comments now....)\n",
      "Don't waste money on this one, I'm really regret now for given up my previous choices (jabra & plantronics). This seemed to be the best headset ever.  It had the most crystal clear sound I have found in a bluetooth.  But it broke and so did my mom's and my friend's.  My mom and my friend went and exchanged it for the new jawbone, but the sound quality on that is horrible, no one can even here them.  Too bad, it was a great product except the flaw. What a disappointment!  Cheaply made. No one could understand me. Incoming audio was difficult to understand.  It kept beeping several different patterns every 20 to 30 seconds.  Customer service had no idea what this was, why it was doing it or how to stop it.  Although they send several different sizes of earplugs and ear holders, I couldn't find one that was comfortable or that would stay on my ear. This was the 4th or 5th headset I have tried and I just about gave up until I ran across the Motorola H710.  It does it all well and I don't even know I'm wearing it.  Sorry Jawbone.  I just don't understand all of the glowing reviews. the charger \"stuck\" to the unit and I had to almost pry it off.  Then the housing on the earpiece came off.  The company basically told me to fly a kite.  No wonder the price has consistently gone down down down.  Apparently the company is having a hard time unloading these.  I'd never do business with this lousy company again Ok, me and my partner wanted this Jawbone because of their advertising of noise canceling so we ordered 2. Once they arrived we put them on the charger. One Jawbone broke before even first use: after the battery was fully charged half of the Jawbone came off with the charger when we tried to disconnect it - horrible charger connection. So, we sent one back for replacement. I started using the other one that's left. The Jawbone connected ok to my Motorola Q but when my phone rings the headset did not; i press the answer button - nothing; I press the answer button on the phone and phone works like there is no BT headset connected. Tried this with 4 different phone same result. So, the next day we sent the second one for replacement.\n",
      "A week later two new headsets arrived. We charged them, connected to the phones and ... both are malfunctioning again. On one we could hear the caller but caller did not hear anything. Tried on 4 phones - the same. We sent it for replacement. The second Jawbone had such loud statick and cracking in the audio that we sent the other back the next day.\n",
      "A week later two new headsets arrived. One would not connect to any phone. Second had the same cracking noise. We tried to call Aliph, the manufacturer (no toll free number available for support) for 4 days, left numerous messages - no one ever returned not one call. Sent them numerous email messages - nothing back.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I would highly recommend to stay away from this very undeveloped product. The idea is great, they just need to complete their testing phase as this product is still in very early testing. I bought theis headset because of other reviews and a recomendation from the salesman that sold me my phone. I have owned more than 6 Bluetooth headsets and this by far has the worst audio quality of any headset I have ever owned. The first call received was while I was at A restaurant in the waiting area with lots of chatter going on between patrons. he caller commented immediatly about the noise and I could barely hear him. I made another call from my vehicle after dining, and the audio quality at the receiver's end was so poor that the person I called asked me to get off  the headsset so he could understand me and even with the audio turned all the way up on my Blackberry Pearl, I could barely hear him.\n",
      "\n",
      "This unit is going back to the manufacturer buy one check it out and return it if you agree. Bought this from amazon after reading all the hype. I had just previously tried the Blueant Z9 and been disappointed (it didn't cancel noise - in fact produced phantom noise of its own to the listener.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I was really hoping the Jawbone would be the killer noise reducing BT headset, but it's not cancelling noise either. And yes - I have the nub touching my cheek. My wife said she could hear all the noise in the background clearly, so I had her use it and sure enough - I could hear everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe I got a dud, but I'm so weary of trying to find a good noise cancelling BT headset that I'm not in the mood to try a replacement - it's going back pronto. Back to the wired theBoom headset for me! I purchased this headset with high expectations.  I took my time.  I compared and contrasted.  I read all the reviews.  I thought I had made a great purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, the ergonomic design of this headset does not match the electronic design.  I can't believe how badly Aliph missed the mark with this headset!\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the good.  The sound from this headset rocks!  The noise mitigating technology is great.  I work in computer data centers the noise level often fluctuates.  The set adjusts both the sound heard by the other listener and the volume that I hear.  It still has very poor quality in windy environments, but I don't know of a set that doesn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the bad.  This headset wouldn't be allowed in Guantanamo Bay.  It is pure torture to wear.  The various combinations of ear bud and ear loop just gives you more ways to inflict pain on your ears.  I can't wear the headset for more than about 10-15 minutes, and sometimes end calls due to the uncomfortable feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "I used to put the set in my pocket between calls.  Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.  I contacted the company and they indicates that this is because if the loop doesn't break, the headset itself would break instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company told me I could \"gently\" bend the loops to fit my ear better.  They also recommended Jabra ear gels instead of the Aliph ear buds.  They also recommended a place that can make a custom gel earbud (for about $65 + shipping).\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked them if it felt right to them that I paid $130 (Best Buy) for their headset and then have to bend the pieces that come with it and buy a competitor's ear gel just to make it comfortable.  They didn't seem to have a problem with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I finally got around the earloop pain by bending a paper clip around my ear and using that for a loop.  I do intend to buy a different ear gel bud because Aliph's just hurts my ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also interesting that when I told them I had relieved the loop problem with a custom bent paper clip, they never asked to see it.  They don't seem interested in improving the feel of this product on the ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "All said, I would never buy this product again and cannot recommend it for use.  The is sound quality not worth the pain. The Jawbone bluetooth headset is not really made very well and is a lot worse than people seem to give it credit for. Parts fall off after a short time and it is very cheaply made.

My iPhone jumped off my belt in this case five times before I gave it up and ordered a different case elsewhere.  I tried it on four different belts.

      "MIT TRASH - beeps out of the box like crazy, won't hold a charge for longer than 3 or 4 30 minute to 1 hour meetings and I sounded like Darth Vader to everyone on the call.  Missed my return window by 8 days.  Extremely unhappy and not sure if I should blame the 3rd party seller or Moto.  Very sad and disappointed considering that my last Roadster (the cheap one) worked fine for 4 years and I only replaced it because I wanted too, not because I needed too.  Now I am stuck with nothing. This product rarely works properly. It needs to be powered off and back on between each call. Even power cycling the product it rarely actually works. Most of the time I cannot hear the person on the other end. Occasionally when I can hear them they sound electronic. Awful product. I replaced a Motorola Roadster 2 that began to fail after 2 years, even failing the Roadster 2 works better than this product. REVISED 11/1/16- DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MODEL- TOO MANY COMPLAINTS OF FEEDBACK AND DISTORTION FROM CALLERS, AND TODAY A RADIO SHOW\\ I PHONED INTO HAD TO CUT OFF THE CALL BECAUSE THE INTERFERENCE WAS BOTHERING THE HOST'S CONVERSATION WITH ME.\n",
      "\n",
      "No problem with the size and the feature-set is typical of other similar units I have owned. But the speakers have a tinny sound and too many people complain about reverberation and echo from their end (they hear themselves). I will keep trying to make this work but thus far I believe that my previous Jabra freeway performed much better. Did Not work I am using this with a Note 5 it has very poor call quality. The person on the other side cannot hear me half  of the time when you press the button to end the call it takes quite a while before it actually hangs up. I feel that putting my phone on speaker actually sound better. I bought this at Costco for $50, and thought to myself, Costco doesn't sell crap (usually), they have limited selection, test what they sell, and sell stuff that works (usually).  This happens to be one of the worst Bluetooth speakerphones I've ever used. When everything is working as it should, it's one of the best.  Unfortunately, that's so rare I've forgotten what its like.\n",
      "In the beginning, it seems to work reliably enough to keep.  Over 6 months, it started to connect with my iPhone 6 when it feels like it, disconnects when it feels like it.  It did the same thing when my 5S.  I've tried everything imaginable to resolve the issue.  Its in the trash.  This is the 2nd, and last, Moto BT device.  Avoid... As usual, still have not found a Bluetooth that at least has me sounding good on the other line. It did work great while I sat parked somewhere but while driving, forget about it. At this time, I am using a Ford Transit and it doesn't work well but maybe on a nice quite car it may work fine for you. I also had problems with the Bluetooth connecting automatically because every time I got back in the van, I had to reconnect my iPhone 6. Longevity of the battery was never tested because I made 2 phone calls with it and I sounded miserable where people on the other end couldn't understand me due to road noise.\n",

      "I went ahead and purchased the iClever Himbox HB01 Bluetooth 4.0 which works much better because you can put the microphone where you want. You will need an auxiliary input in your car, I usually don't listen to radio much and listen to music and shows on my phone so the auxiliary is always on anyways. People hear me fine on it!

      "\n",
      " My first step was to call \"BLUEANT\" customer support (North America) . After a moderate wait I was able to get a live support rep. We went over diagnostics, but within the first minute of the call, his question was \"How much did you pay for this product?\"..When I answered $30 on Amazon.com - his response was \" Must have been refurbished! - send it back to the seller!!\"....When I mentioned the description says - brand new and it arrived in new packaging his answer didn't change.\n",
      "\n",
      " At this point - it became pretty obvious that he'd lost all interest in the call and wanted to just get me off the phone...\n",
      "\n",

      " Their product support and brand standards are probably just like their product - substandard and indifferent I bought this because works for more than one device. Right out of the box, it did not work, only weird noises, I called customer services and it had older firmware. I had to update it and you talk about complicated!! However customer service was great, much better than most. Finally it works and I can hear well. No one can hear me or the sound made them so uncomfortable, they did not want to continue the conversation, even my mother! It has voice activation settings but neither of them worked for me. The buttons are easy to access, it's comfortable, small and less ugly than most. The Plantronics 510 is much easier to use to with multiple devices. I can't recommend this. The unit came and right out of the box it had a rattling noise inside. I would've kept it but was bothering me when driving and I need to turn my head left and right.\n",
      "Also I noticed that it didn't work pretty good while paired with two mobile phones simultaneously.\n",
      "It is pretty small and it feels extremely comfortable, I wish it would've worked properly. After reading all the reviews it appeared this was a very good headset except for the oversized part that fits in your ear.  Since I am a big guy I figured this would not be a problem for me.  I was wrong.  It will not stay on your ear (keeps falling off when I bend over or chew) and it will not fit in my ear properly either.  On top of that I had many complaints from callers on the other end about call clarity and having a hard time hearing me.  I have tried many bluetooth headsets and have finally found one that fits good, easy to wear, and I have had no complaints from callers.  In fact when I asked some people they said I didn't sound like I was in a well and echoing like in the past.  The headset I ended up with is the Plantronics Windsmart Voyager 510 ($40 at Amazon).  I hope this is helpful to some of you. This adaptor didn't work the only thing it did to my shuffle was burn it. It didn't work after that. Don't buy. The one I got never worked.  It's so cheap it's worth trying to see if you luck out and get one that works. This product is not expensive - but it does not work with the current iPod Shuffle - I was not pleased! I hate the fact I wasted money on this product. After 2 days I had 1 hour of battery life. I had to keep it on charger just to have juice for maybe 1 conversation, its not comfortable, and its flimsy. Dont waste your money. This thing doesn't even fit the Credit card slot they give you.  if you put a card in it, the flap won't button.. i don't know how this thing passed QC.  If you have an iphone 5 do not buy this as it will not fit the dang thing.\n",

      "I dumped it for the 12 south bookbook.  love it I don't like to even take the time out of my day to write reviews but this case is so useless, that I must tell everyone so I can save them from the mistake so many of us have made by trusting our eyes. The picture shows you how 4 cards will fit in the wallet but leaves out how the snap will not even snap shut with just one card in the wallet. The snaps are too close together and this wallet is nothing more than another Iphone product that was just put out on the public with the company who sold it knowing good and well that it cannot perform as they have described in the listing. They use slip of hand type pictures on the inside of the wallet to make it look like you have a DL picture sticking though a plastic window when in fact, you have nothing more than three useless postage stamps size windows that are worthless. The company was notified and their response to me on these problems was almost like a script as to how they would be happy to refund you for the product if it is not what you thought it was however, they tend to leave out the part about how they keep the overpriced shipping charges out of your refund. They send it by USPS and keep the rest. They know what they are doing and that is why I would advise you to skip this company all together in the future. They know they are selling less than described products and they don't care. As long as they get to keep your overpriced shipping charges, they are still making money. They are quick to tell you that you are committing fraud if you use your given right and try to charge them back. They want you to believe that you can't charge them back and that they have the last say whether you can get your refund by charge back. They clearly try to sell or should I say rip you off by intimidation. Don't fall for it and don't waste your time or you will be applying for a full refund by charge back because they are not about to give you your shipping charges back because they know the product cannot do what they say it can and only intended to make money on the shipping charges in the first place. Iphone is a complete rip off, and most people I know that have one don't even know why they got it oter than being able to say \"hey I got an Iphone\".  The thing is a IPOD touch with very basic phone functions.....more over priced garbage from crapple made to rake in apple fanboys money.....and they fall for it. I cleaned the screen as recommended in the directions, put on the screen cover, and got quite a few bubbles that I couldn't get rid of. I would have been able to deal with the bubbles, but I couldn't deal with the sticker residue left from the 'helpful' little white tab that was put on the cover to aid in removing the backing. Actually, I did put up with it for about 10 minutes, then I tried to type up a text message and my keyboard lagged a whooole lot. Very annoying. The protector is currently in my trash can. Oh well. They charge about $5 for shipping EACH. I was gonna order 4 of them and they wanted to charge my $20 for shipping! Sleazy. I bought the card and took it on an international trip.  I put the card into my phone\n",
      "and went to the site to activate it, and it said to put in 19-20 numbers, but there\n",
      "were about 30 numbers and letters on the sim card.  It was worthless. I chose this card even though it had mediocre reviews because it was the only one I could find that charged by use, not a prepaid amount.  I went to europe and never used the card/phone and was charged for 3 text messages that I never got.  For $2.40 I didn't fight the error very hard but the fact remains I was charged for services not rendered.  Further, they were were after me for the $2.40 before I even got back from the 8 day trip.  (emails when I got home were already in my inbox)  Its not the money, its the principle, I don't like disingenuous companies.  For a lousy $2.40 they should have just said sorry and written it off.  I would have used the card on future trips but its in the trash now. After doing research for 4 international trips FRANCE, UK, GERMANY , UAE, LEBANON, MEXICO .... Mobal SIM is by far the most expensive more expensive than just using my USA SERVICE , don't waste your money .... there are other options ..... I bought this item after i forgot to add it to my unlocked phone purchase and it was a waste because you cannot use this sim without giving your credit card, which means that even if you only want incoming calls you still need to register. The plan and pricing are not clear.\n",
      "Also, the phone number is in the UK and i was expecting it to be in the US. Came free with phone purchase.  Bought phone as a gift.  Sim card needs credit card to activate.  If it's $20 prepaid, why do you need a credit card?\n",
      "My friend don't use credit card!  I am not going to give any Joe company my credit card info just to activate a $20 calling card. It's convenient, but the charges are astronomical. Even if you only use it for a handful of minutes, you'd be better off purchasing a prepaid card in whatever country you have traveled to. Be warned, Mobal is a ripoff. I got this sim card as a free promo item with the purchase of a cell phone, the rates for this service are really nuts, I probably won't use it. Got the card for free with a phone purchase. To activate the SIM card, you have to provide your credit card number. I asked not to be charged beyond the initial $9.99, so they did not bother to activate... I will not recommand this world sim card,ti is wast of money.i tried to use it in europe,very poor connection. I've always just bought an international phone card when I've traveled but decided to take my own phone this one time and try one of these sim cards. Well, let me tell you. I made about 45 minuets of calls during a total of 3 weeks and my overall bill was $176. So, if you do the math, I could have spend about $13 American dollars on a 10 euro calling card with 400 minuets and called from the hotel or any public phone....or $176 for less than an hour of calls. This was certainly the worse choice I made for my trip and I advise you to NOT buy this! Amazon.com, please consider taking this off your list of products...it is very misleading and cost consumers way too much money after it is purchased. I bought this battery awhile ago for a Motorola Razr I used to charge my phone while I slept at night so it would be fully charged for the day. When I started using this battery I noticed my phone would get hot while charging. One night I fell asleep with my phone charging right next to me on my bed and woke up with a burn mark on my arm. The burn ended up leaving a scar and needless to say I got rid of the phone all together because I'm pretty sure that the battery ruined the phone. I wasn't going to pay the ridiculous high price the actual stores are selling for battery replacements so I thought I'd try this very \"cheap\" alternative. Good thing my contract was up so I could get a new phone. Never again will I buy a battery online like this. Hopefully having a newer phone now will mean I have a good battery and not have to worry about buying a replacement anytime soon. So the batteries ARE cheaper buying them like this, but is it worth getting burned, literally? This is the 3rd \"OEM\" battery I bought via Amazon Marketplace -- as with the others, it was terrible. I ordered form the OEM shop a BR50. They sent a BR56 which is supposed to be even better with 3 hours talk time. It did not last 30 minutes after a complete overnight charge. Nowhere as long as the battery I am trying to replace which lasts over an hour instead of the original 2 1/2 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "OEM sent a counterfeit fake battery --- not OEM. How can you tell? Because Motorola OEM batteries are made in Japan. These say clearly that they are made in china. I had the same problem and returned the same battery from Wireless Phone Accessories and Batteries4Less.\n",
      "\n",
      "AMAZON_- you should be screening these sellers and addressing these issues. There are a ton of posts under every single one of the Motorola Razr battery listing that say they got bad or counterfeit batteries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Theses companies make their money by selling junk, counting on the Amazon customer not to feel it is worth the hassle to return it. For every one I have to return I lose an hour of my time. My time is worth more than th $10 I get ripped off for. But I do it anyway b/c hopefully at some point AMAZON is going to take responsibility for the conduct of their market sellers. AMAZON's new logo is to become the most customer centric company on earth. Well AMAZON, you can start here: Bargain Cell -- which is one of the worst offenders, Wireless Phone Accessories and now the OEM Shop -- what a joke for a name for the last one since clearly they KNOW they are selling counterfeit batteries.\n",
      "\n",
      "I paid $30 for one from batteries4less hoping to get the real deal -- I got the exact same batter I got from the OEM shop -- the exact same counterfeit. So it has nothing to do with the price paid. Just dishonest online sellers. Bought two batteries. Both seemed good for a couple of days. Then they began to die after less than a day even when barely using the phones. Not recommended. I purchased this from Accessory One. My RAZR V3C says it's an invalid battery, and displays the \"<B\" symbol. The phone will not function with it. The original battery still works, so it's not the phone. The old battery just won't provide much talk time any more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The battery is not worth returning, so I'll just scrap it, and not buy any more batteries from Amazon or its affiliates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim The battery I received was I ust as bad as the old one, unfortunately. These likely have been sitting in a storage facility since the time slim Motorola cellular phones were popular (ie, years and years ago). I guess that, within reason, I should not have expected better. I am not looking forward to telling my mother that it is not worth exchanging. I have another Plantronics Blue tooth headset for calls. It works fine.\n",
      "I mainly ordered this after reading the reviews for my iPhone, to do both - answer calls and listen to an \"acceptable\" level of bluetooth music.\n",
      "a) The bluetooth music is BAD. Sound is tinny\n",
      "b) I use this while walking (not running, just walking). The music skips for every step I take\n",
      "c) The stereo headset uses a proprietary connector, so you can't use any other earphones\n",
      "d) the connector doubles as an earloop. Although they give you other earloops for changing out, that only works for the mono earbud. If you use the stereo headphone you are stuck with this single earloop.\n",
      "e) Comes with so-called usb charger, but the usb connector is proprietary, non standard. This means you cannot use any of the zillions of standard usb cables/connectors you(i) have lying around\n",
      "\n",
      "I would have returned this immediately, except that only \"non-opened\" items can be returned.\n",
      "Choose some other product, this one certainly does not work OK it so so, but then I am picky. I think we should get what we pay for. The phone calls really suck, the music that comes thru  is just so so but OMG, the TV. Gezz you have to pull it out of your ear and you can't turn the DOG DAMN thing DOWN! I think it does what it wants to some times. I was so excited about getting a \"convertible\" headset.  However, this one is just terrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The earpiece simple does not fit.  It comes with several different sizes and styles of interchangeable ear canal fittings, but not one was comfortable.\n",
      "- The buttons are very hard to use, and as another reviewer mentioned here, pressing the main button jams it into the ear canal.  Not comfy.\n",
      "- Sound quality was terrible.  Very tinny.  Playing music from my PC was even worse than phone calls - very choppy to the point that it was unusable, and I have an upper-end PC.\n",
      "- Not practical.  Putting it into your pocket without disassembling it first would destroy it. I purchased this unit with my new Nokia through AT&T.  It functions as advertised and I would probably have rated it at least as average except for a most unforgivable feature.  The unit has a single rocker switch that is used for turning the unit off, accepting or canceling a call, and redialing the last number called.  So I have TOO MANY times actually redialed the last number when I thought I was turning it off.  I am sure I could receive electroshock therapy to correctly learn the right method, but it is not intuitive.  I use the phone for business so I cannot risk annoying a customer or vendor with this idiosyncrasy. I had this bluetooth for about three weeks.  And it does not work anymore I had the motorola headset which was great.  Just wanted something new and up to date I will be taking this back two radio shack tomorrow. To get another plantronics another try.  But if you buy make sure you keep your reciept. I purchased this item because Plantronics has had an excellent reputation in the audio arena.\n",
      "\n",
      "The design is EXTREMELY comfortable and looks very professional... that's where everything STOPS!  The unit does not have \"ECHO CANCELLATION\" and conversations around you drown out your voice to the remote listener.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without ECHO CANCELLATION the only reason to purchase this model is if you are trying to annoy the person on the other end of the conversation (e.g. ex-boyfriends, ex-girlfriends, ex-husband, ex-wife, or irratating teenage kids). I purchased a bunch of these since my Girlfriend tends to destroy them on a regular basis regardless of the build quality.  I had bought similar chargers before that did OK. These ones however didn't work even right out of the packaging or stopped working after a few uses.  I only have one left that works about half the time. I know there is always a risk when buying generic, cheap, made in China, stuff like this, but Ive actually had pretty good luck with other cheap car charges like this.  For the price, I figured, Id buy a couple of spares in case one died.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered 3 of these and while the retracting mechanism seems to work very well, two of the three simply did not work.  I tried it in two different cars on two different phones.  In both cases, the red LED lit up, so it cant be a fuse issue, but neither phones indicated that it was receiving a charge when these chargers were connected.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third one does work, but only intermittently.  If I connect it, and leave the cord fully retracted, it does not charge.  However, if I pull out the cord almost all of the way, it seems to make the connection and charge the phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know I could probably return these, but for how cheap they are, its not worth the hassle to package them up and pay for return shipping. The older reviews seem to regard these screen protectors as a decent product but the new ones they seem to be sending out are absolutely horrible. You get three pieces of flimsy plastic and when applied there are hundreds of little bubbles that are impossible to push out. Wiping it down gently with a microfiber cloth causes dozens of light scratch marks that can easily be seen. Horrible quality, horrible product. DO NOT BUY. Ended up throwing in to the garbage. Waste of money. Cover is very thin. There is no way to avoid having bubbles. Not recommended. The description is for iPhone screen protectors. I got iTouch screen protectors which do not fit the iphone and and are larger. now i have to get the right ones again! TOO LARGE.\n",
      "\n",
      "This does not fit correctly.  It is approx. 1mm too long and too wide to properly seal to the surface of the iPhone screen.  After several aggravating attempts to make it work properly, I gave up and am now searching for a better screen protector.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been using PDAs and smartphones for almost 10 years, and always have used screen protectors whenever available.  This is simply the worst I've ever purchased. I actually never used it but here is why.  When I finally got the package it was folded in half with tire marks all over it.  Like the mail man folded it, laid in on the street, backed up right on top of it, and proceeded to power brake and burn out on top of it.  needless to say the screen had unfixable creases and was barely still in the wrapper.\n",
      "\n",
      "it might be a good protector and it really probably had absolutely nothing to do with the seller but I was pretty steamed. This ear piece have a weak reception ,it don't filter out sounds very well,this is a very poor product disappointed. This bluetooth is NOT woth buying. It hurts your ear so bad that you will have to take it out often. The voice quality is NOT good and the person voice drops out often. The battery is also very bad. It does NOT last long at all even on a full charge. I will never buy another Motorola bluetooth again! loved the look and specs, hated the lack of performance.  Bought for my BlackBerry 8320, blew up every UMA-based call I tried (and only BT headset I've tried that did that), marginal quality on cell-based calls, poor range.  Brilliant on/off feature, loved design and comfort, fit, just wish it worked. Made of cheap material....busted after two weeks of use,I would not buy again, bummer . . . . . . Belt clip broke too fast I've used mine for less than a month and it is falling apart in two places. In fact, I have had to stop using it because of the risk of it falling off my belt. The metal clip is too sharp and was ruining belts, so I used the belt loop instead. That makes the metal clip dig in to my side unless I place it carefully, and the clip on the inside puts pressure on the belt loop, which has made it split.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't waste your money on this. This product look great out of the box but a month later the nylon loops that hold the clip and the belt loop is unraveling and  part of the nylon is loose and flapping. this won't last another month. Fell apart within days. Material shredded and seems feel apart. I loved the look of it and the option of horizontal or vertical. But horrible manufacturing. Horrible. I should have listened to other reviewers. I can't believe this product is still offered. My dog ate it before I could send it back. they must be second as the belt loop always come undid sewing Poor quality.,  lasted 2 months Do not get this If you plan on wearing. Protect is great. and start coming apart I wear this on the belt loop and the loop for the belt just got torned and ripped in just 2-months. Not worth the money. It ripped easily. Very weak construction.  Multiple belt system in weak cloth and poor stitching causes the case to tear almost immediately.  A great design, very very poor implementation.  I had to sew mine several times to keep it from falling apart and am just going to replace it now.\n",
      "Avoid this manufacturer excellent concept with the metal clip. But not a good idea as it pretty much eats away at the belt loop its attached too and then it falls apart and becomes useless. Did not last that long. Quality is not that great. If you work in Construction, this is not the phone pouch for you. I have had this for about 2 weeks and the metal clip was coming off.  I then switched to the belt loop and the stiching came apart within days.  Too bad it fits the phone nicely, but the rest is crap.  I have a Reiko cell phone case for my work IPhone (simalar to this) and that works great, if I can find one for the Note 3 I am getting it.  Stay away from this. The threading on the belt loop holder became loose (about 25%) after about 2 months or light use. That made the case completely unusable. I uploaded a picture of the problem after I tore the holder all the way off to illustrate the poor stitching.\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE:\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered and received a new case&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-II-2-N7100-I605-L900-I317-T889-Tmobile-All-Version-Reiko-Black-Leather-Pouch-Case-Cover-with-Belt-Clip-Holster-and-Loops/dp/B009RFC4IU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Samsung Galaxy Note II 2 N7100 I605 L900 I317 T889 Tmobile All Version Reiko Black Leather Pouch Case Cover with Belt Clip Holster and Loops</a>. My Galaxy Note 2 with Zerolemon battery fits nugly within this case and the magnetic holder just closes. It takes a bit of effort to extract the phone from the case, but I think it will work fine once the faux leather expands a bit. In terms of construction, the clip mechanism appears to be strong and durable. For belt use, there are actually 3 loop sections; I would be very surprised if they tore off with normal use. If there is any weakness (TBD), it might be in the stitched elastic sections that expand to accommodate wider phones. Time will tell... This holster appears at first to be strong and durable, and for the most part the case itself is quite strong, but within two days of normal use (no abuse) the stitching that secures the top of the metal clip ripped, causing the holster to hang outward at an odd angle, which then caused it to catch on various things and cause the stitching to tear even more.  This happened with two holsters purchased from two suppliers, so I know it isn't a fluke.  You'll have better luck if you use the belt loop, but then you'll have a metal clip pressing into your hip on the inside of the belt, which can be uncomfortable.  Also, if you like to wear your phone vertically the holster holds the phone a little too high (I believe this is to balance the phone when worn horizontally), which is part of why the phone tends to hang outward.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a couple weeks the stitching around the belt clip continued to unravel, and there is a design flaw in the belt loop (the loop is actually a two layer loop where the inside layer allows you to wear the phone on its side, and the outer loop, which is sewn on top of the inner one, supports the clip and allows you to wear the phone upright) that makes the holster hang too loose to allow vibrations from the phone to be felt by the wearer.  The vibrator in the Note 2 phone is already way too weak, so when the holster design doesn't allow for efficient transfer of the vibrations you might as well have your phone set to silent because you'll never feel a call coming in.  I have to manually check the phone every few minutes to see if any calls or texts came in, and I can't count the calls that I've missed since using this holster.  I tried re-stitching the clip and outer loop directly to the case (basically got rid of the loops), and while that helped a lot it's a lot of trouble to go through.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, while it's a nice feature that this holster has enough interior space to accommodate a bulky case on the phone, it also means that if you don't have a bulky case the phone will flop around in the holster so you won't be able to feel the vibrator very well. Looks great even fits the note with a cover on it, but the clip ripped from the pouch after only one week of use. Its a waste of time and Money..... The Jawbone bluetooth headset is not really made very well and is a lot worse than people seem to give it credit for. Parts fall off after a short time and it is very cheaply made. It looks metal but really is cheap bendy plastic material.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, once you set it up, you can only use it on one ear. Other headsets (like Plantronics ones for example) allow you to swivel the earloop to switch ears if you get tired of using it on one ear. The Jawbone doesn't do this.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the Jawbone's noise cancellation does seem good that's about all it has going for it because your voice still sounds muffled, soft and digital-like. Further, the Jawbone is too big and bulky to comfortably put it into a pocket to take with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "But my main complaint is with the Aliph Jawbone company customer service itself-they are absolutely horrible. They advertise on their website that the Jawbone has a 1 year manufacture warranty to the end consumer. But, my Jawbone broke and when I contacted them about getting warranty service on it, they rudely informed me that they only provide warranties on units bought directly from their own website. If I bought from some other retailer, it has ZERO warranty! I'm not sure whether or not this is even legal since I'm not a lawyer, but do believe it reflects very poorly on the company that they don't even stand behind their own products.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would never recommend buying this headset or any other made by Aliph. I had high hopes for this but was let down hard. It sounded like I was inside a tin can. I tried it with the Noise Shield on and off but no difference. The caller on the other end didn't notice that effect but the removal of background noise for them was no better than my favorite, the Plantronics Voyager 510. The other big issue was the fit. The ear loop is slightly spring loaded to keep the mouthpiece sensor pressing against your cheek. This is intended to allow the sensor to differentiate between your voice and the background sounds. The problem was that the spring tension of the ear loop was slightly pushing the headset off my ear. It comes with several ear bud sizes and two ear loop sizes. I tried them all, on both ears. No luck. It was held on so loosely that the slightest lean of my head to that side and off it came. Completely unacceptable and far worse than all the others I've tried. I have tested 8 different headsets. The way I do my tests is to pair two headsets, put one in each ear, and then switch between them while on the same call. Even if I ignore the fit problem (a deal breaker for me) the sound quality was poor. Worse for me than the caller but why bother, I'll stick with my 510. I purchased this headset with high expectations.  I took my time.  I compared and contrasted.  I read all the reviews.  I thought I had made a great purchase.\n",

The set adjusts both the sound heard by the other listener and the volume that I hear.  It still has very poor quality in windy environments, but I don't know of a set that doesn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the bad.  This headset wouldn't be allowed in Guantanamo Bay.  It is pure torture to wear.  The various combinations of ear bud and ear loop just gives you more ways to inflict pain on your ears.  I can't wear the headset for more than about 10-15 minutes, and sometimes end calls due to the uncomfortable feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "I used to put the set in my pocket between calls.  Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.  I contacted the company and they indicates that this is because if the loop doesn't break, the headset itself would break instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company told me I could \"gently\" bend the loops to fit my ear better.  They also recommended Jabra ear gels instead of the Aliph ear buds.  They also recommended a place that can make a custom gel earbud (for about $65 + shipping).\n",

      "The company told me I could \"gently\" bend the loops to fit my ear better.  They also recommended Jabra ear gels instead of the Aliph ear buds.  They also recommended a place that can make a custom gel earbud (for about $65 + shipping).\n",

      "As long as you sty away from all the Non warranty products U R SAFE. IF YOU WEAR THIS DEVICE, YOU WILL HEAVE YOUR EARS BLISTER OR TURN RED. IT HURT SO BAD AFTER A FEW MINUTES WEARING IT. I HAVE TO ADMIT, IT LOOK LIKE THE 60 STYLE EAR MUFF Not the original one. Very bad product. To fragile. Is broken already only last week and half.  Fraud product. Bad quality. Not recommend to any one. Amazon don't advertise i bought this phone for my daughter for when she had sleepovers and school functions. However i thought i was safe with the pay as you go... we bought a $10.00 card for her, and used it a few times... still had a balance, however the fine print said that it uses $.35 per day if you use the phone or NOT. Thus sucked up our $10.00. When I called to place money on the card a couple of months later, found out that since we have not used the phone in over 30 days, and the account had a balance of 0 for 30 days, we had to buy a new sim card costing $9.95 plus pay for extra minutes. This IS NOT WORTH IT! You are better off adding a family line at $9.95 a month, and using your AT&T or T-mobile sim card and plan. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME like i did! Also their customer service SUCKS... For a plan designed for kids, the service is designed to trap you to keep pouring money into their account, not as an alternative family friendly phone for kids. This is the most painful headset I've ever used. The sound quality is no big deal either. The fact that it is not easy to put on and take off quickly makes it so you have to keep it on if you don't want to miss a call. But keeping it on for a couple of hours caused me pain no matter which size ear pad I used. The charger is only for home, so no quick charge in the car in any emergency. The Jawbone is much better for comfort and I've had no problems with it at all as far as sound quality. The jawbone charger is its weak link, however, as with time it becomes loose and difficult to connect to the device.\n",

      "I'd stick to the old H700, with good noise control, great comfort and the ability to charge anywhere. I bought this product with high hopes and high expectations. After a few weeks, it started having alot of static, battery life was terrible, and the range was terrible. I am trying to return this product right now. I am very dissapointed. I bought this headset for my wife. She can't use this unit because it constantly falls off of her ear(no bud for ear.)I use it as a backup in the car when my jawbone battery is drained. The sound quality is choppy. The only good point is it syncs very quickly with my cell phone and the flip mic feature is convenient. I would recommend Jawbone, Plantronics, or Jabra well before this unit. This headset wasn't the best quality - it was great for me, the talker, but the mic didn't work so well. The person on the other end often had a hard time hearing me when I was talking in a quiet environment (forget it when in the car!). I'd recommend something else. Sound started cutting out after just a couple weeks. Threw it away Will not stay in headphone jack I purchased 3 of these through the seller WELLGOAL. Each had faulty and misaligned connectors, resulting in messed up audio. If you've ever pulled your headphone plug out slightly, and only heard echoey background music without the vocals, it sounded like that. All 3 were also slightly different lengths (bad quality control?). The adapters did not work on the following devices: iPod Nano 4th Gen, Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, iPod Touch 4th Gen, Kindle Fire HD.\n",
      "\n",
      "I contacted WELLGOAL for a refund, but they insisted these adapters were ONLY FOR iPHONE 3G AND 3GS, and thus were not defective. If I wanted to return them, they said I had to pay for return shipping and restocking fees. I balked, and they offered me a 20% refund if I simply kept them. I ended up doing that, as it was the cheapest option. But I will be avoiding WELLGOAL from here on out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also - BEWARE of re-ordering an item from your past orders. I had initially purchased a similar item from X-eParts (aka, eForCity), which worked GREAT with my devices. I wanted to order more of those. However, since the seller no longer carries the item, Amazon quietly shuffled me off to a different item with a different seller. That's a little deceptive. its a very good price. but you will find it does nothing.\n",
      "I needed a way to put a large headphone plug into a tiny jack hole. this is not what i expected it to be. really there are nicer tools for you to get nearly as inexpensive this is not the tool you want! This thing did not work at all. Don't waste your money. It was a cheap piece of crap. Buy somewhere else. Its has already had a wire broke some where inside the covering, had to throw away, not worth sending back These things got such bad reviews - that I ordered 3 just to be sure I got one good one (at least they're cheap). I gave them two stars instead of one since, oddly, 2 of 3 of them worked for their intended purpose (a size adapter for my iPhone), though none of them work when plugged into my PC. Hard to imagine this is a very difficult product to manufacture - so I just assume the manufacturer could simply care less...\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE: Turns out my 2 star review was way too generous. All 3 of these eventually stopped working properly. A truly staggering level of apathy by the manufacturer... I bought this for my original 2007 iPhone.  The one with the recessed headphone jack.  Remember that?  You had to use the then-new super-skinny headphone jack that came on the apple earbuds, or buy an adapter.  Well, the product description said it fit (it was later changed).  I contacted the company to complain, and they said I'd have to pay to return the item, which cost more than buying a new one.  So I threw it out.  Too bad.  Waste of time and money. This is very flimsy, both connectors and the cable.  Mine only works if you wiggle the phone end and hold it just right.  Obviously pretty worthless like that.  Forget buying this one, even if it works when you first get it don't expect it to last more than one or two uses. I bought several of these as a workaround for cases that have too narrow a plug hole on the iphone5 I also started using them to protect constant unplugging of my itouch & headphone jacks that were too large. After a few days one side shorted out & it was the adapter connection that had frayed even though it was never removed by wire-always carefully handled...i replaced it w a new spare but several weeks of trying to figure out what the sound quality problems were with new headphones and whether it was a ripping/ download setting....finally discovered the distortion & thin sound was this adapter!! I used another since i had  a third i had yet to use and same result!! These are crappy sounding adapters that might allow you to plug in a headphone for a week or less but also GREATLY compromising sound quality! Does not give you Left and Right channels like it should. Music in unbearable and incorrect. Do not buy this. You cannot use the remote controls with this case on iPhone.  I got mine from elago.  Every vendor may be different.  The annoying part is that they are all under the same item and there is no way to figure out unless you buy it. Purchased 2 of this item to use with iPhone 5.  Neither work appropriately.  They alternate between making popping sounds through the speakers or transmitting only the left channel. Not adaptable for Square credit card swipe. Adaptable only for headphone. Need more information on the website guideline on this product. It works but not for what I needed it for. The female end is thicker than the picture. This does not work where I needed it, where only apple size jack would fit. Sure there are three rings on the male end, but there are only two wires on the inside of the cable and female side.\n",

      "I wish I could offer zero stars. So I lost the adapter that came with the Lifeproof case and was really being cheap when I ordered this one. I learned the lesson the hard way :(.  The seller is not at fault here, I actually received my item way ahead of schedule.  The sounds comes through really strange, like its an echo from inside a tin can.  Tried with multiple earbuds/headphones and the problem persisted.  Just go with the real lifeproof adapter if you can find one in stock. Purchased from Eforcity, US seller that I've gotten a few items from before and quality was good for the price.  Not this case.  Item is the proper fit, and fits bumper cases or special cases that would only accept an Apple headphone jack (ie thin).\n",

      "But, at first, I was getting audio from just one channel - Jiggling a bit the cable at the base of the male end, 2nd channel started working but was getting static noise by just moving the cable.\n",

      "Audio would then come and go, by briefly moving the cable.\n",

      "Filed claim for damaged item.  Seems to me a $1.70 down the drain. The adapter is wired for something other than an iPhone. The sound is distorted and the microphone does not work with the standard earbud headset that comes with the iPhone. If you hold the pause button the sound comes through correctly which indicates that the wires are crossed in the adapter. I received the item pictured but it doesn't work at all! No sound comes through it at all, even if you use the Apple headphones with it!  Don't bother wasting your money on it. It worked only for two months then stopped working, well, it works on one side only, the other earphone get no sound. I thought I would need one of these for my iPhone in order to use a headset with a normal 1/4 inch jack. WRONG! my Sony's work just fine without this convertor. Don't waste your money, not that it's a lot, you just don't need one.... this is borderline trash. it works just enough, and just long enough to make you thing youve got a bargain. but then, you get sound from one earphone only. or none. depending on the velocity of a butterfly's wings in china. don't buy this unless you like to be disappointed. I purchased this item and it would not work when the headphone was plugged in all the way...the sound was muffled.  But it worked fine when the headphone was plugged in 3/4 of the way.  Eforcity sent me a replacement at no charge but unfortunately the replacement doesn't work at all. Beware, you will not get the item that is pictured.  You will get some sort of iPhone recessed port adapter (kinda like the Belkin one) but not nearly as good as the one in the picture.\n",

      "Tells you what kind of seller you're dealing with. Cannot keep the wire connected to my phone. these things are good, for about a week. These would have to be used in a stationary application where they will never be touched because when I use it with my iPhone, as gently as I possibly can, the cable starts to short out. At first I lose the microphone, then I lose theory and the ability to change volume, then lastly the audio goes out and it's over, a generally I throw it away at step one (after troubleshooting it, of course) nope.. don't fit my apple iphone as advertised.. too much trouble to send em back...\n",
      "but not super happy.. Used it the first time and it shorted out the AUX port on an iPhone 5S.  Will be returning it and now replacing an iPhone.  Sticking with the original Mophie adapter when I get a new phone. The cable rubber part is way too thick! I wanted to use it for my extended battery...and it doesn't fit! The description said that it will fit even with a case, and its not true. The picture don't matches with the product delivered. It will not work for my purpose. It is a regular extension of a headphone. I was looking for an extension that had a jack as the apple headphone jack. Does not look like the picture, barly fits with my iphone case. The end came with some paint/whiteout on the end which comes off on your hands and on my phone case. Useless and doesn't work for plugging in paypal pay here. Why make a product that doesn't work? These are single channel audio. it will not allow sound from both channels. It would be good if they were removed from the site because they are not a compatable with apple iPhone for audio and therefore false advertising. It will not play full audio and it is not compatable with accessories. don't waste your money I bought this to work with the Thermodo temperature gadget so I could keep my iPhone case ON my iPhone and not have to remove it. This 3.5mm headphone adapter makes temperature readings with the Thermodo about 20 F lower than that it reds without the 3.5mm headphone adapter. 1.

      "White adapter received from seller \"eTECH\" (mailing label said \"iflash Inc\") - 1 star:\n",
      "The item looks identical to the one from CRONUZ. The only additional concern with this adapter is that I can't get the headphones to plug into this without using A LOT of force.  I did force them in to test the sound quality, but I don't plan on using this cord again. Also, because the 2 white adapters look identical, I would think this is a problem you might encounter no matter who you order from.\n",

      "This adapter also has a flimsy cord. The plastic on the male end is slimmer and will fit into a tighter spot than the 2 white ones I tested.  The hard plastic ends seem a little more durable than the ends of the white ones. I believe I can get some use out of this one, but wouldn't buy another one.\n",

      "First of all, the 5 stars is based on this being less than $2. I wouldn't say this is the best adapter you can buy. This is however the best one I tested. The cord is stiffer and feels more solid than the others.  The female plug has a tighter fit and no play. The plastic around the male end is slimmer than all the rest. This cord doesn't meet my immediate needs because of the longer plastic head, but I would buy this again for use with certain iPhone cases that block larger plugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you order this or any other item and don't receive what was pictured and listed, contact the seller.  Most of them would rather just give you a refund because they know they are shipping a different brand than what is listed. Shipping service is terrible.  Don't expect to receive your order for at least 2 weeks.  Product feels cheaply made, like the wire will snap at any moment, and above all, it does not work if you need all 4 channels. Didn't work The product description is inaccurate.  I selected it because the original iPhone has a recessed headphone jack, unlike later models.  This causes a problem for third-party headphone plugs, which are too wide for the narrow recessed area which leads to the jack.\n",

      "If it had been accurately described, I would not have purchased it! While this adapter does pass the stereo signal to the headphones it does not pass the microphone signal as stated in the description. In other words it is not a full 4 conductor adapter. This item gets a dry-joint in the iphone side of the connection in a few short weeks. And then you're stuck with it. I rarely got the product to work - it would connect and then disconnect. When it did work, the audio quality was terrible and the volume too low. The menus were too confusing - couldn't figure them out (and I'm an engineer). I tested it with my Verizon XV 6800 Pocket PC phone - and later found from a friend that this company's products have problems with HTC produced Pocket PC's (which manufactured the phone), and this is according to their own technical support people.

      "The ideas was nice, and that is why I bought it. The Marketing sells you something the Product Design does NOT deliver! I bought this earpiece for its capacity to connect to two bluetooth cell phones, incidentally I also liked this company's CallPod Charger.  When I got the Dragon, I found it extremely uncomfortable to wear.  The rubber earpiece that is supposed to go inside your ear was too stiff for me and after trying to wear this earpiece for 30 min or so I had to take it off.  I contacted their customer service department explaining my complaint and they said they had a fix.  I received in the mail a new ear clip which is the part that goes around the back of the ear.  Since my problem was with the rubber piece that goes inside your ear, this fix did not help me.  I also expected much better sound from this unit, but I got noticeable interference, even when wearing my cell phone on my hip so that there was only 2 feet or so between the Dragon and my cell phone.  I liked the idea of the upgradeable firmware.  I did perform this upgrade, but didn't notice any improvements.  The upgrade process was kinda picky and I had to try many times to get the software to recognize the Dragon.\n",
      "In comparing this rubber piece to my in-ear earphones, I found my earphones were much softer and more forgiving, but I was unable to fit the spares from my earphones onto the CallPod Dragon.  I should have contacted the customer service dept again, but I didn't, so the Dragon just sits on my dresser unused. I ordered this kind from a diferent seller and when arrive top fron where it folds over the plastic underneath is always coming apart as was the same problem with this seller seems to be a manafacturer issue so i wouldn't recommend this item the vinyl may be better and have less chance of this issue but no more will i buy this item fro mthis seler or any other seller as i am closing amazon account out because too many sellers having issues reviews will be posted about this item ands sellers online review sites I purchased this item and was very disappointed because this is not the cable I was looking for.

This looked like an interesting and relatively low-cost option for my wife's car/cell phone, since she hasn't found a bluetooth headset that fits her ear comfortably.  Unfortunately, we cannot get this unit to pair with any of three cell phones (iPhone 3G, two new Nokias).  It goes into pairing mode as advertised, but none of our phones can find it (they all find all of the headsets and computers we have tried pairing with other than this unit).  Makes this rather useless, and I would strongly suggest testing your phone against one of these before ordering.\n",

I bought this product based upon the excellent reviews it received.  Unfortunately, in the real world its just not even close to what you would expect.  The volume is just too low, even when set to max.  I could not even tell when people answered the phone.  If I had to do it over again I would get one of those units that work through the car speekers. Could barely be heard when using this bluetooth device and not easy to hear who I called. Got progressively worse as power level was discharged. I do not recommend this product. My Garmin NUVI 660 has better bluetooth audio quality. This is a rugged case, but you will not be able to sync/charge using a docking stand.  The screen cover is designed poorly and trapped air makes it difficult to see the icons.  There is another popular case that is just as strong and will allow you to dock eaasy.\n",

The case is cumbersome and you cannot dock the phone without removing the case, which is difficult because it is in three peices.  Customer service is a joke. Bought it for myself to use at the gym. The Distance is amazing even goes trough walls. But the volume level is terrible, it is very quite, no matter how loud you put it on the player and the bluetooth, the volume is just not enough. I don't know maybe for some people it is enough but i do not recommend it at all. UPDATE: i was able to connect this device only to the Sony ericcson phone and this device has failed to connect to any other phone after that. I have tried multiple brands of phones like Nokia, LG etc but none of them seem to connect to this device even though the phones seem to support this device.

Samsung phones block one of the ports for bluetooth which enables the bluetooth phone to connect to devices (Samsung claims that this is done to prevent viruses from using this port to access the phone and destroying it. No other phone company does this to their phones!). I was able to seamlessly connect this device to my other sony Ericsson phone almost instantaneously.

The back panel, blocker and bottom part are separated when I got it. We tried to put it on, but it still cannot stand well. Way smaller compartments. Picture is completely innacurate. Neither of the side compartments are big enough for my iPhone (regular iPhone 7). The picture shows BOTH compartments with iPhones (and the right one looks like an iPhone 6, which is the same size as my phone). False advertising.

That's enough tries, I am now going to look for a different product that likely will not fit needs as well as this one should have. I bought this for my mother who ONLY uses the phone for emergency calls.  It lasted her 3 uses and I had to buy her a replacement due to cheaper than dollar store quality.  I guess yiou get what you pay for :( Extremely cheap design, guess you get what you pay for. Lucky for me, I won't have the phone for very much longer. Crappy SIM card I had unlocked my old AT&T quad band phones and I thought this would be a good way to use them as backup phones.  Come to find out, T-Mobile SIM cards work just as well in the unlocked phones and they have a much better \"gold\" customer deal that starts with a $100 airtime card (1000 minutes) and a $10 SIM card that also has 100 minutes.  They key is that the phone number is good for a year and is extended by adding more air time. Not at all as described. Didn't even look like pictures. Extremely flimsy. I could just image it would dent very easily. I returned with no problem. It was cheap, but still not worth the few dollars. A word about Sprint: They used to be the best, and they are now the worst.

First they sent me the wrong silver case then sent the half silver case.  FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!!  They've since put up pic of the front to show u that the case only protects the bk of the iphone.  Great if u only drop yr phone on its back!!!! My old Nokia 6101, which is almost three years old, has served me well and still works like a champ.

I immediately took the SIM card out of the 6263 and put it back into my 6101, and sure enough, the 6101 was like using a landline phone -- the sound quality was perfect. Just to be sure, I put the SIM back in the 6263 and tried again, and sure enough, the sound was positively miserable.\n",

It would cost more to mail it back and get a refund then it is worth.  I guess you get what you pay for and that is the last time I buy anything from this company! The idea was great but it is junk it does not charge and does not retract once you pull it out-don't buy it you'll waste your money! did not charge the phone, would cost more to ship back than it is worth, I guess it is the chance you take.

Overall, it is heavy, and feels like cheap plastic.  STAY AWAY! not so good cheap broke really fast I put this on the window and it popped off a few times I think because it was so new and stiff.

After I started using the cover, I immediately had complaints about how bad my voice sounded, and I assumed it was my new phone.  I finally removed the cover, and suddenly my voice was crystal clear.  The problem was that this cover design is completely faulty due to the covering of the tiny microphone hole at the base of the phone.  And unfortunately if you use a small knife to cut out the hole, it will weaken the case and won't hold up.  The case itself tends to slip on the phone, and the appearance is uneven (some parts look white, others look dark due to how the material contacts the phone).  This cover is going in the garbage where it belongs. Virgin Mobile is the best prepaid service provider. TracFone is just HORRIBLE (minutes go as high as $.50 a minute and text messages are $.30 each and I think you have to pay to receive text messages with TracFone. With Virgin Mobile, its $.25 a minutes for the first ten minutes of the day and $.10 a minute after that. Text messages are $.10 to send and free to receive. A lot of content is available at virginmobileusa.com for putting on your phone (ringtones, celebrity voicemail greetings, MTV and Comedy Central Content, and a lot more). You only have to play $20 every three month which is A LOT cheaper than most cell phone service providers. And best of all, NO CONTRACTS!!! Virgin Mobile is the way to go for prepaid phone service.

Received this item New Replacement 9 Cells High Capacity Li-Ion Battery for IBM ThinkPad Compatible Models in a timely way, properly packaged. However, it failed to charge on or power my Lenovo-IBM ThinkPad T60 -- a laptop explicitly mentioned as compatible with this battery. The laptop's charging system did not detect the battery, and no amount of workarounds seemed to help. I do not know if the failure to detect the battery was due to the lack of an identifying chip in the battery, dead cells in the battery, or no cells at all in the battery.. In any case, returned it to Amazon (free return shipping) for a full refund. A+ to Amazon; -0- to this vendor (fulfilled by Amazon) and product. Purchased a different replacement battery from Amazon and that seems to be working just fine -- it was twice the price of the failed one. TANSTAAFL! (There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch!)

I would not depend on this if it is going to get wet. There was a bit of sea water in the bottom of my kayak and this radio fell in it. It filled up with water and ceased working. Otherwise it worked pretty well and was pretty cheap. But calling this waterproof is very wrong. It is barely water resistant. God forbid your boat was sinking and it got wet. This is basically a very cheap plastic case.. if you want to be cheap... go for it. The case always unsnaps itself randomly for no good reason. You have to somehow put it on just the right amount to get it not to unsnap. However, you still can easily unsnap the case off and I'm just glad the phone hasn't fallen out yet. The swivel clip is also very very hard to press down and take out the phone... You are going to have to have your fingers pushing on both ends of the clip in order to get the phone out of the clip.

After making numerous threads at various forums regarding this question, reading countless reviews, watching many videos, looking at hundreds of pictures, and mapping out the pros and cons of each one multiple times, I have settled on the Sony Ericsson W580i.

My OTHER sister, who also got a Sony Ericsson, also gets great battery life with hers. Rather than the claimed \"3-4 day charge\" that many people on this forum and others are claiming, I have found that the phone will last over a week (11-13 days). The LG Shine, which is said to have poor battery life, disappoints: its battery life is indeed very short. The papers that the LG Shine comes with claims that battery life is around 3 hours of talk time, up to 240 hours (10 days) of standby time, is standard marketing bull ****: through a test of 10 different charges with three different batteries, the phone has lasted no more than 3 days before it required a charging.\n",

      "Durability: People say the LG Shine has a stronger build than the Sony Ericsson, but if you actually compare the two, you find that you cannot actually compare the two... Why? The SE is a plastic phone; the LG shine is a plastic phone with metallic components. One thing that is not usually noted is that the Shine actually has VERY little metal in its body; it's only the battery cover and some of the front. The LG shine doesn't really feel that much more durable than the SE. If you drop the shine, you will certainly damage the screen, and/or scratch the body, and/or break the phone. With something plastic, eg. Sony Ericsson, a drop will do no more than give a few scratches. Regarding the slider mechanism, the LG Shine's \"snaps\" when you open and close it, whereas the SE's slider is not as snappy. Due to the difference in the way that the phones slide, it isn't really accurate to say that one feels more durable than the other. Since the durability was one of my biggest concern in getting the phone, I did a test of each phone upon cracking open the box: I opened and closed each phone 300 times. Results: The LG Shine's slider remained the same; the SE's slider got smoother after the test.\n",

Walking around with the Shine put in my side jeans pocket for a day, the Shine went in looking stellar and came back looking pretty poor. The back plate had obviously been rubbed on, the front plate exhibited small, but noticeable scratches. I'm sure you could prevent the Shine from getting scratched by getting a screen protector and/or case, but the hassle of one is not something that I'd want to deal with (not to mention such protection would take away the \"beauty\" of the Shine). The Sony Ericsson, as one may predict, does not scratch easily. Same jeans, same walk, and the SE still looked great after. There was something that looked like a small scratch on the front screen on the SE, but nothing a wipe could clean off. Speaking of which, with the LG Shine, you cannot wipe the phone with any shirt; it will scratch if the fabric of the cloth/shirt is rough. A BIG reason people get the Shine is because it looks good. Well, if you don't take care of it like a newborn baby, it's going to look like **** and ipso facto, it was a poor decision to buy the phone for its looks.\n",

Most of these complainers are complaining from hearsay (they repeat what they read/hear from others, not from their own experience). The problem of cracking keypads is also a huge concern for potential buyers of the SE. First, to address the keypad. The size of the keypad is very usable for texting and other usage. I have 6'2\" and have large hands and I can still manage to comfortable use the phones' keypads. Texting with both is very easy (albeit not as easy as texting on a RAZR). The SE's keypad is not as responsive as the Shine's, meaning the click down are not as solid, and that the row of numbers are connected so that one press on a number slightly depresses the row, but nonetheless, it is very solid. The LG Shine's keypad is like a smaller version of the RAZR. Regarding the cracking keys on the SE, I performed a test to see if this rumor was true. Over a period of 2 days, I had the phone off and during my spare time (which is a lot since it's summer), I've been clicking away at the keys (with a good amount of pressure I might add), and the keys exhibit no sign of cracking. Clearly the cracking keys is an issue with older phones (which you could potentially still buy if the reseller of your phone has old stock).\n",

It is very easy to use, and is not too small. The SE, with no joystick, as imagined, is also very easy to use.

I have found the number of signal bars that you get has a big impact on the call quality (as it should)... The Shine frequently echoes what the other person says, and a background static seems to be present in all calls. To ensure that I didn't receive a lemon shine, I tested a friend's shine and sure enough, it was the same. My friend told me they didn't notice the static (he probably got use to the poor call quality)... The SE's reception and sound quality it top notch. No complaints whatsoever here.

For a piece of equipment that costs considerably more than a standard charger the performance is quite unacceptable. To be clear, I'm talking about the charger and tips, not just the tip. I would not recommend this. This is a defective design -- I've gone through many of these, all with the same failure -- the metal tip bends inside the plastic boot at about a 30 degree angle.  This happens during normal use -- plugged into my phone in my car sitting still. CAUTION:  To get an entire product usable on your device you are likely to have to deal with TWO, maybe MORE, separate vendors, shipments, multiple shipping charges, and hard to find specs on what tip fits what Exactly which devices.

      "I would avoid this product like poison! I got this bluetooth to allow my wife the freedom to speak while driving with our newborn. I thought it to be stylish and given the positive reviews I figured why not. Within two weeks of purchasing this product it stopped working. We continually tried charging and recharging, attempted to connect and reconnect the device to the mobile phone but to no avail. Sadly I threw away the packaging in haste and am stuck with this useless product that is now where it belongs, in the trash. Furthermore during the first week when the product worked, the reception was staticky at best. This headset was very statiky and did not work well.  I ended up returning it.  I purchased a few on-line which did not work at all.  I would stronly reccomend buying a product like this from a brick-and-morter store.  It might save you a lot of hassle. Returning as soon as I locate the pieces or not Does not hold on to the phone the glue on the sticky side was no good I was looking for a durable case that would last.  The leather part is great and high quality. The belt clip is poorly made of cheap plastic and has broken 3X. I've already replaced clips and refuse to order more. Weak and breaks easily....I am disappointed! I prefer the metallic clip that can last forever......I have tried all plastic clips and not one has changed my view that these plastic clips are not long lasting. Broke within minutes of me attaching it to my phone and clipping it to wat waistband. Do not waste your money. After charging overnight, I paired this with my HTC 8525 PDA phone from Cingular (AT&T).  Unless I am willing to hold the phone next to the headset, the Bluetooth connection gets very noisy and will likely drop/disconnect.  This not only looks ridiculous, but doesn't qualify as hands-free.\n",

      "I may try another unit in a few months, hoping that I just received a defective one or that a software upgrade may improve the radio range. I followed the directions to a T but found out quickly that the covers are difficult to get clean before application and that no matter how much I squeegeed, I could NOT get any bubbles out. They just moved from place to place. It made the phone look a toy from a slot machine. Since it would have cost too much to return them, in the trash they went. Too bulky & feels plastic like, not rubbery. Not worth it, the phone is a POS as well. Waste of money. Makes buttons hard to push and the center wheel all but useless. Used it for a day then took it off. I should have gotten one that just covers the back and sides leaving the entire front open. New article. I received the item (product) damaged, also the charger. Lousy article. Would not recommend buying it. No need to buy it. I bought it and I brought him a friend to Ecuador . I can not return it . From here there is no way back. Do not buy it. Didn't really like it cause it never worked. It never opened up I mean come on. Tried every ways to make it start. The prongs on the two pieces wouldn't work together. Never worked. Tried taping it down, too, but that didn't work either. Just threw away money. I ordered this to replace my ball that was lost when I dropped my phone. The replacement ball did not work very well. It took forever for it to respond to motion in any direction (up, down, left, or right), and if it did respond it would move just one space/item and then you are stuck again trying to get it to move more. Needless to say I ended up purchasing a new Blackberry Curve, this time with the touch pad instead of the trackball. ask for more money for express shipping and it takes longer than regular mail.  It took almost two weeks to receive item.  I wrote to seller and seller never contacted me. BAD is not unlocked This phone was so basic, it was little more than a thin calculator. The manual was all in Spanish and some of the menu options on the phone itself were too. Couldn't distinguish between lower and uppercase and just a general dirt-cheap phone. Would never recommend to anyone. I bought 8 phones to travel to Haiti on 5/6/10. I took the phones with me and none worked. I added the slim card and the phone says no slim. I do not trust them. Motorola motofone F3 is a piece of trash. yes it's big number. letter are hard to read old tech. phone, black & white, no color. not easy to use. too much money for the junck. HORRIBLE PHONE STAY AWAY FROM IT.  COULDN'T EVEN SAVE YOU IN AN EMERGENCY!!!!!!! I WAS SO AGGRAVATED I THREW IT IN THE GARBAGE.  IT IS SO CHEAP.  I WAS BETTER OFF GETTING MY SON HIS REPLACEMENT PHONE FROM GO PHONE AT&T ...IT WAS CHEAPER AND BETTER QUALITY! I bought this phone online. I liked it because of its looks and its so called \"ease of use\". When I finally got it I was so dissapointed. Looks can be decieving indeed, hehehe. Its not as \"cool\" as it look online. This phone seems to be from the 80's but slimmer. The screen display is like a flash back from the calculator screens of the early 80's,the font are so big that it cannot even display the whole phone number in the screen. Even the fonts are weird, they are like written by a toddler. But I don't do much text messaging so I can live with that ugly screen display/font. But the signal of this phone is terrible too so I cant even use them for regular phone call. Dont buy this, it will just be a waste of money. Even a third world country will consider this phone a piece of crap. Sound quality good, screen is absolutely unreadable.  Buy any other phone except this one.  I own one, thought of giving it away but didn't want to offend anyone else, not even an enemy.  I decided to bury it in my back yard, please don't tell the EPA. Oh what a POS.  I bought this phone thinking that I would get something simple, reliable, and no hassle.  I got none of that.  Went 0 for 3.\n",

Oh an also, the date format is in Euro/Australian form (whatever, I don't what standard they use, but it's not American). Case is too small for phone with or without case on phone. not safe for cards, items fall out very easily. Poor material quality, not leather, more like thick plastic. This product is cheaply made and TOO small for both my Samsung Intercept AND my credit cards! Therefore, it doesn't serve its purpose and is useless to me. The quality of the product looked pretty fair when it arrived. I snapped the back piece on without a problem. I went to snap the front cover on and only 3 out of the 4 corners fit!!! I tried multiple ways to \"make it work but the front cover was just too small. When I went to pop the back piece back off it took about 20 minutes of delicate prying to get it back off and almost broke my phone in the process. Stopped working after a week. Bad predict and the company didn't care to answer my emails let alone resolve the issues Died at one year. Not happy at all with this purchase. I can barely get 40% on my phone or ipad with this thing charged completely. It's another piece of electronics for the junk drawer. I really loved this when I first got it. It charged well and the battery lasted a long time. When I went to charge it a second time it would not charge. I do not know if mine was just defective or what but I had to return mine. I really wanted this to work but it never charged my phone for more than 2 minutes. Don't buy it. It worked great for 2 days, then completely died. Won't charge or turn on at all.  I never dropped it or abused in any way, it was hardly used.  Poor quality.  Do not buy this. Do not waste your money or time with this product if my experience is typical:  this took an initial charge, I used it to re-charge my ipad (and it was incredibly slow and did not fully re-charge the ipad), then re-charged the device, got all the lights, stored it, and then went to use it in a week, and it had no charge, and wouldn't take a charge.  Completely dead.  Waste of money, avoid this product. Looks great, only it stopped charging 3months into the purchase.  I only chargedbit about 3 or 4 times too.  Now it sits on my desk as a paper weight. I used this once. Now it doesnt see the charger unless I push it in hard - and when I do, or use a different charger, it never charges. Now its for the landfill. Gt the product for free, basically purchased the larger charger and received this guy as a free gift. Well, it's junk. Device doesn't charge. When plugged in the charge lights come up for a few seconds indicating its charging than the unit shuts down. Like many other posters, mine probably is defective. Anyhow, my advice is to avoid. This battery never worked. Would not hold a charge. I left it plugged in over night and the battery never charged up. After a couple of months of use, battery won't charge what a waste of money . . I think its waste of money to buy a charger that only last 3months . Unpacked it and plugged it into a charger. The second, third and fourth LED's lit up. Seemed to be charging OK, and external LED and laser light worked fine.\n",

      "Back it goes. So glad I spent the extra $4 so I would have it in time for a weekend trip. Knowing it come with half charge, I went ahead to charge it. After draining full charge, It won't charge anymore. I don't recommend this product and there are better alternatives. the connection cord is a mini usb and it broke on me the first week, i have no idea how to contact the company I bought this product from New Trent and found it to be okay. Not great, but okay for the price so I did not complain. Weeks later, a representative from the company sent me an e-mail saying they would like to thank me for my business by sending me my choice of a free battery pack phone charger. Of course, I accepted. The representative then e-mailed me again requesting that I post a positive review on Amazon in exchange for the free charger. I replied that I would not wholeheartedly support a product if I didn't feel that way and that bribing someone for a favorable review made me question the ethics and products of the company. Furthermore, there was absolutely no mention of any review in the original e-mail proposing the free \"thank-you\" charger. New Trent's representative quickly backtracked and offered to send me the free charger if I did not mention this exchange to anyone. After all the e-mails back and forth, I ultimately received a charger that does not even work, aside from my original purchase which was mediocre. Since the charger was a \"free gift,\" I didn't expect much out of it. However, New Trent's request for a positive review on Amazon has now caused me to question how many of these reviews are actually real. Based on this and my experience with their mediocre products, I would think twice about dealing with this company in the future. I haven't gotten the battery to work with my iPhone 4.  The first few times it worked fine, but now every time I connect it I get a warning saying it is an unsupported accessory.  I emailed with the manufacturer and they said they'd contact me with info on how to get a new device, but I still haven't heard back (after trying to email again many times).  Doesn't work at all for me. The product arrived and I read the instructions and charged the battery for the recommended time. Product did not work, It had no charge.  I charged it again, and\n",
      "then same issue.  I was only offered a refund and not a replacement.  The product in my book is suspect.  Be advised that you may have to go through multiple purchases and shippings in order to receive a functional device. Please do not waste your money ti doesn't worth it. I regretted ever buying this. It is very fake one! This item came in tried it immediately & it didn't work. I could hear them they couldn't hear me thought it might be muted but called motorola  they said needed to be replaced .It may have been great if I could have got it to work wouldn't stay connected to a phone, wouldn't hold a charge and it was new.  Definitely not worth any money in my opinion. I work in a office and started wearing this on my belt so it wouldn't fall off, unfortunately it is already tearing after only 1 month of being strapped on my belt. I ordered 2 of these.  I bent the clip on mine the 2nd day I owned it, and I use it on a belt.  My wife uses hers to clip on the edge of her pocket and the clip wasn't strong enough to hold.  Neither case would hold a Samsung S3 with a cover on it, and I'm talking only a MyBat cover, not one of the bulletproof Mil-Spec ones.  If you're using a smaller smartphone, or don't mind removing the protective cover, it would be an OK case, but even then it would have the crappy clips. I ordered the case. This case will not fit the Sprint Q9c phone w/ the extended battery. Yes, it does fit very snugly into the case - but that is about it for the good.  I also got a charging pod for the phone, but no cutouts in the case for that - pain #1.  There is no easy way to get the case off if you need to do the occasional \"pull the battery\" - first time dropping was trying to get the case off, pain #2.  When it dropped (see #2), the case popped right off and now there is a scratch on the corner of the phone...too snug to pull off but easily falls off when it hits just right...#3.  Typically when you holster a phone, there is a magnet that puts the phone into the \"holstered\" mode, no such thing here - #4.  When I read the description, it appeared as though you could easily remove the wheel that goes into the belt clip...not so, only a screw driver and pulling off the sticky pad will allow you to actually convert from belt to pocket (unless you don't mind the star thing jabbing you) - #5.  You have to really push hard on the release mechanism...to the point that you knock it off your belt (or miss the call being gentle) - #6...and it goes on.  At least I got a car charger out of the packaged deal - the case isn't worth the time or shipping. The case I received is NOT as it was pictured on Amazon.  I purchase it ONLY because I wanted exactly what was pictured.  The case I received has an elastic band stiched into the leather side straps.  This will fail over time and the cell phone will fall out.  Don't waste your time and money ordering what is pictured.  That is not what you will receive. Received this product yesterday.  It is completely unusable, as the LG Voyager fits so tightly into the case, that it's nearly impossible to remove the phone once inserted.\n",

      "There were also no belt loops as depicted in the photo, just the belt clip and some weird plastic snap thing that wouldn't really prevent the phone from slipping off the belt clip.\n",
      "\n",

      "This is not a phone for people who use it for work Barely worked better than not being hooked to it at all.  I was hoping for much more. Didn't work at all for me. You have to have a minimal signal first. What's annoying is that they don't tell you that anywhere. It took three emails to support to find this out. Very disappointing. For reference, I get one or zero bars where I was trying to use it. Junk, bout to replace a old unit and wouldn't even pick up celluar signal using the excact same positioning, lines, and long range antenna. Do not like this product, it does not show very well if it is functioning to carry signal and gives the feeling of being made of inexpensive plastic.  It is easy to install and set-up, I just wish there was a way to tell for sure it was receiving and brodcasting its signal better. This is a joke.  No help at all...nothing. Do not water time or money. Prefer to give no stars. This cell booster wasn't good enough for my location. If I turned it on I could send a text, but I couldn't call or access the Internet. So I returned it. Maybe someday I'll try the big weBoost amp (https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00WMFXE5O/ref=aw_wl_ov_dp_1_12?colid=17Y61221O28QJ&coliid=I3EPZ3F2RA70SX&vs=1) for almost $500. Did not show an improved signal within the RV.  Not noticeable enough to justify the cost of the unit.  I returned for a refund. Love the idea. But the metal connection to the amplifier from the antenna is RED HOT. I'm not saying it's warm, it's hot enough to burn me by barely touching me. I want to give 5 stars. I just want to do it painlessly. Please contact me ASAP\n",
      "JIM At least I got all the pieces to this one, as the last one I got was missing the antenna  and I had to ship it back. I set this up in my office, and got the green LED,  acknowledging the unit was powered up. Put my LG G4 in the cradle and saw no change in the  reception bars. Pulled up the dB meter in the phone setting  and after several rounds of testing determined that the booster was having no effect at all , a 0dB gain in signal strength under any conditions. Just to make sure the booster was  defective, I brought in an older Wilson Electronics Sleek that I have been using successfully in my home for a few years now. I used the weBoost  antenna with the older cradle and it worked great, 8-12dB of gain without even fussing with it.\n",

      "I was already a bit leery when I saw the company had changed its name, as this rarely if ever spells an improved product from any entity.  Unfortunately my suspicions are confirmed, and what was once one of the best products I ever bought (I have 3  WIlsons) , the quality of these weBoost units seems to have declined severely. I'm returning this one for a refund, not a replacement. Maybe I had a defective product. IDK. It didn't work. I have the small, gray box, Wilson mobile booster and that one works fine but in comparison in a poor signal area, I got 2 bars with my gray box and no bars with this one. It also became extremely hot. Way hotter than it should be. These boosters typically do get hot but this one was far past that line. My phone shut itself down after about 5 minutes from getting too hot with it. I returned for refund. Amazon was great with the return. No hassle return. Thank you Amazon. poor quality DIDNT WORK DONT BUY Very disappointed in results. Did not amplify cell strength. Plastic should be thicker. I use Verizon 4G LTE and I read a lot of reviews for this product before buying.  A lot of reviews said that it worked with their Verizon 4G LTE and that this product no longer gets hot which is why I bought this.  It gets extremely hot, and my signal doesn't get better or worse when I use this product.  I had to remove the brackets completely since I suppose they were designed to hold small flip phones or something, because there is no way my Samsung Galaxy could fit in this thing. I wanted to return this product but they wanted to charge me a 20% restocking fee so I figured I would make sure I am using it correctly.  I wanted to give them a chance since I travel for worked and used it in a lot of different places and my signal never got worse or better when using this product.  The signal strength on my phone remained exactly the same.  This device also kills your vehicle's battery very quickly since I suppose it uses a lot of wattage which is why it gets so hot.  I suppose it works for different networks even though they claim it works for all of them.  If you asked me I would say that this company is a scam, and I am not that type of person to throw around false labels.  Especially since they renamed this product and charge a restocking fee, they probably are aware it doesn't work and will pack up and leave once the word gets out that this product doesn't work. As always, Amazon is amazing in making returns and high customer satisfaction. My problem is not with them, but this device. It simply DOES NOT WORK. I contacted weBoost expert technical support and verified that everything was installed and operating properly. I have my phone set to show db numbers, not bars, and there was virtually NO CHANGE in the signal. Not even 1 single db boost. I bought the additional 12\" antenna and tried both the supplied and additional antennas, but it made no difference whatsoever. I have a Dodge Mega Cab truck with a metal-roof ground plane the size of most entire vehicles, so that was definitely not the problem either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Add to that what others have said about the unit getting hot (really hot) and forget it. What a waste of money. So glad Amazon takes such good care of their customers so that I don't have to sweat about this. I'm shocked that there are reviews on this product with people saying it actually makes some kind of difference. Personally, I think it's the placebo effect... they want it to work, so they think it works. In addition to speaking with their technical support, I have a deep knowledge of electronics and I am a licensed amateur radio operator. Trust me when I say, don't waste your money on this hype... it's nothing but a gimmick. I had the previous version made by Wilson for 4G Verizon. That one works well indoors. Not the best boosting, but enough to hold a 3G or 4G a a bar or so.  So I had high expectations for this one which was twice the cost of the previous version when I bought that one.  But this one did little, to no, to even slightly worse signal \"boosting\".  Sadly.  If it had increased signal strength by a few bars I would have given it 5 stars. But it basically showed no improvement from the previous booster.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tested it indoors where I am using the older version, in the exact same spot, with the antenna in the same precise location.  I also turned off the other one when testing to avoid interference.  To no avail.\n",
      "\n",
      "I barely get a bar with the older version.  The dB strength was consistently lower with this new version sadly. Did not boost my data signal.  Very clumsy.  Had to take the arms off for the Verizon jetpack to set on it.  The connection cable got very hot when plugged in....too hot for fingers.  That made me uncomfortable. The cellular booster didn't work for me. Reception was not improved enough to warrant the $250 plus cost for the device. I have an ATT hotspot for internet service, that wasn't improved either. I live in a rural area with marginal cell phone reception and had high hopes for this unit.  Unfortunately, I ended up disappointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The installation of the weBoost Drive Cell Phone Booster Kit is very easy:  place the magnet-mount antenna on the car roof, run the cable in through the door and attach it to the unit, then attach the power cord and plug it into the car's lighter outlet. My HTC One M8 phone, at 3-1/6 inches wide including Otterbox case, just barely fit into the unit's cradle, which must be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "The instructions suggest powering up the Weboost and watching the bars rise.  Starting with 1/2 bar, I plugged it in, looking forward to doing exactly that.  No rise.  The power adapter showed only a solid red light.  The instructions direct the user to the online manual for this issue.  After something of a fishing expedition, I found the manual, which says the red light means the unit has powered off due to oscillation and the fix is to move the antenna.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, moving the antenna did not change anything.  The quick-start installation instructions say the antenna must be mounted at least 6 inches from a window; the user manual suggests 8-10 inches.  Within those parameters, the antenna is as far from the unit as it can be while still being mounted on the roof of my full-size car.\n",
      "\n",
      "The instructions next suggest calling customer support.  I'll update this review if that proves to be helpful. Sprint PCS has terrible network coverage with frequent dropped calls.  I have been a loyal customer of Sprint for 10+ years, mostly because of a nice grand-fathered plan.  However, many moments of frustration plaque me.  Accordingly, I jumped at the opportunity to review this product (Free Vine Review).  Installation is straightforward, but requires external mounting & some wire routing.  All would have been acceptable if it worked.  Unfortunately, I still experience the same drop rate and poor coverage as without the booster.  It could be due to Sprint network or the fact that my car is a low 370z.  Accordingly, this product receives a 1/5 star. Tried every combination and watched the install videos.  Not one bar different. I do live in the middle of nowhere. I was researching ways to boost cell signals when I found this. After reading many reviews I realized that the issue of weak cell signals can be fixed, easily and permanently, with a cell phone that can use WIFI to make receive calls text and data. A weak cell signal is a common problem with concrete and metal buildings shielding those signals out.  And many live in areas where cell signals are just weak.  But we always have access to WIFI at home or in the office. Republic Wireless solved this problem over two years ago. It uses VOIP calling backed up by both Sprint Cell and Verizon roaming. It also works world wide on WIFI for $5 a month. Service is unlimited and has no contract. An unlimited call and text plan is $10 a month, and unlimited cell, text and data is $25 a month. You do have to use their phone (Moto X $299 or Moto G $149) because they need Republic's proprietary software to work at these rates. I have been using them for over 18 months now and it has worked perfectly. Tried this in the mountains and it failed to do anything.  We have Verizon - people with Iphones sometimes get signal at my house but we have Droids and there is nothing. The booster didn't do a thing for the Droid.  Disappointed & returned. Ok, I wanted it to work because I needed it.  I have an older home with thick plaster walls that effectively block my cell phone signal completely.  I use my cell as my only phone so I need it to work at all times.  I can get three bars if I step out on my front porch but as soon as I go inside and close the door- no bars.  So, I thought this would be perfect because it would grab the outside signal and bring it inside where I needed it.  Well I went through the trouble of hooking it all up- getting the two green lights and following all the conditions detailed in the instructions.  It did NOTHING- had no effect whatsoever-  I began to feel like I got scammed.  I am returning it.  The outdoor antenna box feels like an empty piece of plastic- I wanted to look inside but probably would not be able to return it if I did.  I've read the reviews about there needing to be a signal to amplify- that's why I checked the signal outside.  Maybe it does work for some people just not for me. I had to return it because it did not meet my application.  In our home which is 3 stories,  it did not boost the cell phone range well. I bought this signal booster hopping it would solve our problems with the inadequate AT&T signal we get here at our house.\n",
      "It was expensive and it did work but only if you were standing right next to the booster.  I put the antenna up above my roof a good 15' and aimed it in all directions.  No good.  Raised the signal only one bar.  Returned the item and had to buy a new cell phone using Verizon towers, which worked and cost a lot less that this booster.  In my opinion, don't buy it. Firstly, Amazon sent me a damaged package (NOTE: The item was purchased DIRECTLY FROM Amazon and not a third-party vendor) .  The damaged package was not the shipping package but the item package itself.  I refused to even open the item (assumed very likely the package contents has suffered considerably) and immediately began the process of returning the it.  Having read about Amazon's diminished quality control online and customer service, I have to wonder if Amazon has gotten \"too big for it's britches\" that they would allow such shoddy merchandise to leave their warehouse and such poor quality controls?  Perhaps damaged items returned to Amazon are completely ignored and simply re-delivered out to the next online purchaser/victim?  I would imagine this to be a waste of money and imprudent as for return shipping costs that they are supposed to pay (more on this later) and damaging reviews of their company reputation - such as this one.  I am of the opinion that it may actually be better to purchase items from a reputable third-party vendor (presumably small business) --> who cares about maintaining a good business reputation as it is their bread and butter!  To continue, Amazon immediately scheduled a UPS delivery, however they were on days when anyone one was home to physically hand over the package to UPS.  I contacted Amazon about this and asked them to schedule a pickup on a different date during the week wen someone was home - however this fell on deaf ears.  I tried to reschedule a pickup 5 times in fact!  Each time, my request was ignored.  I have to wonder if this was by design as now I have to pay the return fee! :-(  I will be following up my return with a request for a refund on shipping charges!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, (a replacement for the damaged item I had received) - as for the Wilson Cell Phone Signal Booster for Small Home item itself, this item really only boosts about a 400-500 square foot area and I and say square foot because it barely even boosts anything on the first floor (no -- make that:  IS USELESS on the first floor!).  Perhaps Wilson might want to re-label the item \"for efficiency apartment \"home\"  \"?  I am working on an alternative solution for the first floor however, I am considering returning this item as well as per false advertising. Purchased with the intent of boosting the cell coverage of a location in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis.  We moved into a valley where an old golf coarse was.  Very poor cell coverage so I looked into finding ways to create a safe communication tool without getting a land line.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a new home I was not in the mood to attach anything high up on the roof/window where the device might get a better signal to boost.  I also was not interested in drilling holes in my new home to hid  the wire...... so after limited increase in signal and satisfaction from my spouse I returned the device. When you buy this item are you REALLY expecting to first figure out where the nearest cell phone tower is to your house and in exactly which direction?  Then are you REALLY planning on climbing up on your roof to erect a pole so that this thing can point directly at that cell phone tower?  No, like me you're thinking you can stick this to the window and it will increase your reception.  Well it won't. So my suggestion is don't buy it; you just end up returning it the way I did. We have been using one of these at work for several months with good results, so I assumed it would work\n",
      "just as well at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Received box, and setup the same way that we did at work, boosted my signal, but after 20 min I could not make or receive calls. I unplugged the unit and 30 seconds later my phone was going crazy with incoming texts and voicemails.\n",
      "\n",
      "Called Wilson, was told they have never heard the happen.  So back it will go, unless I can find someway to get it working correctly. I returned this product. It did not perform as described.  I tried both an inside and an outside installation. The outside installation did increase signal strength, but the inside installation did not increase the signal. The problem with the outside installation was that I live in a region that has a lot of thunder and lightning storms. The added expense of the outside lightning protector made the product too expensive. it is listed as good for 2500 sq feet it was only good for 18 inches. i called wilson tec services and they recomended additional equipment that would have  cost and additional $500+ This product was difficult to set up.  Once I had set it up, I pluggeg it in and the light flashed green once and then went out. Never got a light again of any color.  I had no effect on my cell signal.  I sent it back and got a refund. Most of these batteries were dead on arrival. I wonder how long they've been on the shelf. All 5 batteries tested dead! Worthless!! Lasts 3-6 weeks so you better buy a lot of it. These batteries only last a week each for my watch, which is a very standard one. I never reserve my battery's. While this is clearly a well made product, it only works WITHOUT a case on your iPhone. For me, that is a deal breaker. I have no interest in taking my iPhone in and out of a case each time I want to mount it in my car. If you do not use a case, then this is probably a great product. If you use a case, look elsewhere. the Arms on this will not adjust properly, so unless you drive a buss or something with vertical windows prepare for the glare. the suction cup failed regularly as well, i did send this back and was refunded and went and purchased a different griffin mount that works great! I have been protecting the screen of my BB curve for the past 3 yrs. I custom cut it from a long universal plastic screen protector. For a change, I order this product and dismayed of it. The good side of it are a.) it has a tiny cleaning cloth; and b.) 100% exactly the same size of BB screen. The bad side are: 1.) it can't be re-applied if you mess-up; and 2.) one of the 2 tabs that said \"please peel of this mask before application\" is harder to remove. The paste on it had dried signifying that it is an old stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is faster and satisfying to cut the old way. I odered 5 pieces of it (5x3 =15)and it would take me awhile to finish it off. I wasted 2 already in my initial application. The first was trash-out cause it would not stick for re-alignment. The second, I used a wet napkin to remove the dried paste and it not only leave scratches on new screen protector but the dried paste can't be removed at all. The more I attempt to remove the dried paste, the bigger the area it spreads its sticky mess.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not worth returning and will just throw it away and go back to the old way of doing it. That was so not cool, I searched for a screen protector especifically for my Blackberry 8350i and when it arrives, it doesn't fit my blackberry!!!!! I am so pissed off, they either sent me the wrong product or advertised it wrong. Either way, I didn't take any action because the product is so cheap that it would cost its price to return it and it's too much of a hasle.\n",
      "I did still put it on my screen even though it doesn't fit (too big) and amazingly it still didn't fall off and looks very transparent and it's very protecting. If this fit my phone it would've been the best product ever because the quality of this thing is very good.\n",
      "Seller, if you're reading this, I deserve a real 8350i Blackberry Curve screen protector.\n",
      "Thanks. According to the specifications this headset supports Bluetooth 1.2, as well as the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) and the Audio Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP). I could not get any sound to come out when connected with my Sony Ericsson w600i in phone or Walkman mode, and people could not hear me when I called them. I tried every setting possible, read the instructional booklets for each device and the thing still wouldn't to anything when connected. I am guessing that this headset works fantastically with any Motorola device, but as far as I'm concerned this product is guilty of false advertising. After this experience I do not plan on buying any Motorola Bluetooth devices. WAY TO EXPENSIVE!!!!!!!!!!!! The seller sold me what they claimed was a brand new OEM LG battery. When charged it only lasted 30 minutes. It drops 3 bars in that time. That is WITHOUT using it. I mostly only use my phone for texting. There was NO mfg. or expiration date on the battery so who knows how old it actually is. Real batteries have a date on them. It wasn't even in the original packaging. Could be a faux LG battery. Total junk. Seems to be scores of negative reviews about them selling defective batteries. 166 negative reviews is pretty bad and not a coincidence. They had the gall to ask me to remove my negative review of them. Amazon should be contacted just how many buyers received defective batteries. They should not be allowed to sell anything on Amazon. What a sham. Doesn't hold much of a charge.  The seller on my Oders shows it was sold by Battery King.  Knockoff?  Refurbished?  There you have it, why it's the price it is here. Worked less than a week then would not even hold a charge......save your money buy a new phone. A cheap product. They sent the wrong battery for the suggested phone. However they are working on sending the correct battery for the phone. This battery was NOT an LG battery.  The image does not clearly show fully the size of the battery, or she shape of the connectors.  They were wrong, and do not work with my phone.  The item in the photo is NOT LG compatible.  The photo carefully does NOT show the part that fits into the phone, which is NOT the kind that works with LG.  Is a completely broken object of garbage that did not work for two seconds.  I did NOT have enough money that month for these jerks to be wasting it.  Do not buy this at all!!! Both Amazon's product description AND the Nokia website say that this phone has pop3, etc, email.  Amazon's description mentions it several times.\n",
      "\n",
      "It does not.  The manual does not mention it, and it is obviously not present on the phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I returned it immediately, and did not spend much time with other features.  The display is brighter than the older Nokia 2610, although scan lines are occasionally visible.  The menu speed is also slightly improved from the 2610, although still slower than any of the low-price Ericsson models. WORKED WELL USED IT ALOT. IM GLAD I GOT THIS BATTERY HELPED ME ALOT WHEN I WASNT NEAT A CHARGER We received the BR50 battery a few days ago for my wife's RAZR cell phone.  She tried using it for a few days after charging it and it won't hold a charge after making a couple of calls. It is actually worse than the old battery we tried to replace. It turns out this \"new\" battery was made in 2006, according to the code on the battery.  The old battery that we were replacing was made in 2007! So we put the old battery back in. I probably won't bother to try to get a replacement since I only paid $7.29 for it. If you buy one of these try to verify the manufacture date ahead of time. This \"new\" replacement battery I bought at Amazon.com and received from ZenithMobile is probably used as it held its charge for barely 48 hours with minimal usage.  Trying to contact ZenithMobile multiple times proved futile since they would not respond.  Finally, I complained to Amazon about it and they did reverse my charges for the battery.\n",
      "\n",
      "From now on, I decided not to buy any product from third party vendors at Amazon.com.  I would only buy them if they are sold and shipped by Amazon.com.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any way, thank you Amazon.com.  You lived up to your reputation!! This is the 3rd \"OEM\" battery I bought via Amazon Marketplace -- as with the others, it was terrible. I ordered form the OEM shop a BR50. They sent a BR56 which is supposed to be even better with 3 hours talk time. It did not last 30 minutes after a complete overnight charge. Nowhere as long as the battery I am trying to replace which lasts over an hour instead of the original 2 1/2 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "OEM sent a counterfeit fake battery --- not OEM. How can you tell? Because Motorola OEM batteries are made in Japan. These say clearly that they are made in china. I had the same problem and returned the same battery from Wireless Phone Accessories and Batteries4Less.\n",
      "\n",
      "AMAZON_- you should be screening these sellers and addressing these issues. There are a ton of posts under every single one of the Motorola Razr battery listing that say they got bad or counterfeit batteries.\n",

      "Theses companies make their money by selling junk, counting on the Amazon customer not to feel it is worth the hassle to return it. For every one I have to return I lose an hour of my time. My time is worth more than th $10 I get ripped off for. But I do it anyway b/c hopefully at some point AMAZON is going to take responsibility for the conduct of their market sellers. AMAZON's new logo is to become the most customer centric company on earth. Well AMAZON, you can start here: Bargain Cell -- which is one of the worst offenders, Wireless Phone Accessories and now the OEM Shop -- what a joke for a name for the last one since clearly they KNOW they are selling counterfeit batteries.\n",
      "\n",
      "I paid $30 for one from batteries4less hoping to get the real deal -- I got the exact same batter I got from the OEM shop -- the exact same counterfeit. So it has nothing to do with the price paid. Just dishonest online sellers. This product is awful. It was ok when I installed it, but then it didn't even last long. Right after applying the screen protector, it immediately showed signs that the adhesive wasn't strong enough. The edges were lifted and it allowed dust to get inside the protector. It could've been great, but the adhesive was just useless. I guess that's why it was only 98 cents. The mirror is cool but during the day it makes the screen harder to see. I tried two of these with the same 3-pole (stereo audio, mic, control) headset in the same iPhone, and in both cases, one of the audio channels would either play static or nothing at all.\n",

      "Buyer beware. nah Bought it for myself to use at the gym.  The Distance is amazing even goes trough walls.  But the volume level is terrible, it is very quite, no matter how loud you put it on the player and the bluetooth, the volume is just not enough.  I don't know maybe for some people it is enough but i do not recommend it at all. When I plugged it into my computer, the whole computer turned off. When it powered on, I received this message from the BIOS: \"USB device over current status detected\" and it shutdown after 15 seconds. I'm running a self-built computer with an over 900W power supply, and I only had 1 other USB device connected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of curiosity, I tried it in another USB port (on the back) - same result. Also, the same result in my Toshiba laptop. I also tried it in a USB wall charger I have, and it produced an electric arc. Obviously, it doesn't work. I'm just glad it didn't damage any of my hardware.\n",

      "See if you can find a better quality product - this one is junk. Unfortunately the cable did not work for my LG Shine model CU720, it caused a power surge on my computer's USB port when the phone was connected. I'd strongly suspect, given all the positive reviews here, that it's simply a defective cable and not a design fault. But more unfortunately, the seller refused to reimburse return shipping on their defective cable, and the shipping cost is more that the item price. So I'll just have to toss it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately I immediately located an OEM cable right here on Amazon that cost only slightly more and works perfectly. I received it in just a couple of days, too. So I'd urge anyone who needs a cable fast and without drama to get the genuine item and not the cheap generic. It didn't work well at all. Everything we plugged in with it flickered like the electricity was not steady. not compatible with my phone need to send it back WAY TO EXPENSIVE!!!!!!!!!!!! Couldn't hear very well out of this device.  It did not fit properly in my ear, and everyone I talked to complained on the humming noise or not being able to hear me. Units - 2 of them- would not sync or work with any of my laptops. Returned them via Amazon printed UPS label over 7 weeks ago. Still wating on a refund. Amazon says they cant refund the charge, only the merchant.\n",
      "Guess, I will have to file a dispute with AMX. I had one of these headsets previously. One of the earphones broke off. I bought this set as a replacement because I did like the first one overall. Within two weeks of very light use, the earphone broke off a second time. I knew this was going to happen eventually because the headband is pretty flimsy, just wasn't expecting it to happen so quickly. I will not be purchasing a third one. This headset does not cancel outside sound. It also isn't very loud and broke broke a couple days after I got it. Very cheaply made! Update: As other reviews state - the thing will snap in 2 with normal use. DON'T BUY THIS! While it sounds great, it will break with normal use after a short while. Samsung's \"warranty\" doesn't cover the obviously defective design - well, someone should sue them because the language in the written warranty covers DEFECTS and this surely is a defect if you see how many people have had this problem!\n",

      "\n",
      "Gorilla Glue: this is really good glue\n",
      "A piece of flexible metal - looked around my parts box and found some sort of bracket - strip of thing metal, and I cut it as it was a bit big. Bent it to cover the top and bottom of the band and gorilla-glued it. After 24hrs, put black duct tape around the repair job and it's lasted several months. I actually cut off a small part of the broken band near where it snapped because I have a thin face and wanted a slightly tighter/snugger fit - and that's what I've got now.\n",
      "The headphones are still uncomfortable to wear for more than an hour or so as others have said as they dig into the ears, but I do like them for the gym and around the home as a bluetooth headset for voice calls with my phone. Just can't wear them for more than hour at a time.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Final?] Update - Sep 2010: They keep breaking in new places. After the sixth break in the headband today, I've given up trying to repair it. So, I found a pair of headphones that I no longer use (traditional over-the-head band), and took the earpieces off. Used Gorilla Glue to blue the Samsung earpieces on. Now, the fit and comfort issues are gone - and they won't break again either. But, the cable between the 2 earpieces isn't long enough - so, right now I put that behind my head... I am thinking of cutting the wire in 2, and splicing/sodering a piece of cable in so they can go around the band over-the-head - altho will require some skill as the wires inside the cable are very very thin. not working Sent it back in just under a month as the phone stopped taking a charge. Got my $ back at least. Poor I just opened my boxes to get a charger out, and these phones do not charge, itis one bar on the phone after charging for a while, the phones aren't navy blue either, they are some other teal blue, I'm going to open all of them and if they don't clear, I'm sending them back and let amazon know about it.  I just found out I cn't return the phones, I bought 4 of them because they were so good when I bought my first one from ATT.  Big mistake to order from you, and also, one of the boxes do not even have a charger that plugs into the wall, just a computer charger.  I lost $257.00, and can't get it back, but at least I know not to trust your company, even though you sell from amazon, the other amozon products are bought were excellent, but your products can't be used, because I cn't charge them, the adapters don't work. DONT BUY IT. WASTE OF YOUR MONEY. The back cover kept coming out. I did not know what to do so I sent it back but never got the money back. What a waste of my time and money. This phone never worked...I couldn't return it because I bought it for someone in another country....this was a pure rip off ppl be aware the phone came with out the owner's manual, and head set. The battery was dead and the phone doesn't work (doesn't turn on), battery wouldn't charge. I have the previos model of this Motorola and it works fine, but this one I received about a month ago, is useless, the battery goes dead even if you don't use it.  What a waist of money, I would ask for a money refund if that was possible. Returned and defective. Was sold to me as NEW when in fact USED. Phone never worked properly and was defective. But they did make up for it and made it good. dis not worked Garbage won't get signal any where The telephone would not recognize the sim card. I would like my money back. Too small and certainly not worth 50$. Disappointed . I was really excited about getting it until I did. Then I realized it truly was too good to be true The seller did not realize that Its a Motorola RAZR V3a.  There is a difference.  It does not take sims cards.  It says V3a on the inside of the phone.  I wanted a V3.  This phone is not compatible with T-Mobile.  Its only compatible with  alltel.  I was also sent a cable to recharge with out the plug to put into an outlet.  very disappointed! We purchased two of these phones one pink and the other black.  Black one center arrow buttons would not work so did not get past that and returned it.  Tried to make a call with the pink one today and it would not work correctly, they could hear me I could not hear them.  So it is now in the process of being returned.  How can this company sell such junk?\n",
      "I am very disappointed and frustrated and am going to go back to my old phone at least it still works.  The other problem I saw was that the battery did not sit in the phone properly and the back cover did not want to lock in place. Returned and defective. Was sold to me as NEW when in fact USED. Phone never worked properly and was defective. But they did make up for it and made it good. this phone is the worse shapping i have done Nt compatible with my service Came in Spanish programming. Can't read it. Going to Mexico to fix it. Doesn't work I like the phone when it worked but every time it stay with you out side it would die Wanted a simple phone for my dad to travel with but when I received this phone it had no sound no matter how high the volume settings were, it can only vibrate, and the battery life is beyond unsatisfactory, the moment charge is complete it took about 10-15 min. or less before it hit the red, it's complete garbage and a total waste of money, DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!! I purchased a Droid 2x almost 2 years ago. Over year ago Motorola stopped providing upgrades and the phone has missed calls and needs rebooting regularly. It does not always sync with Google calendar, bee restored to factory, replaced completely 2 times including a new battery and still does not work properly. Motorola and Verizon both refused to replace the phone with a equal phone other than the same one even thought the phone is insured. Go to Best Buy, they honor their warranty with a phone that works equal to what you bought at time of purchase if you have problems. DON'T USE ANYMORE BECAUSE FRUSTRATED WITH CONSTANT MALFUNCTIONS AND DROP CALLS.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOR PURCHASE IF YOU LIKE CONVENIENCE. My mom missed having a RAZR phone and I got this for her. But, when I got it I was excited but after opening it I realized how cheaply put together it was and it just felt so brittle in my hands. I don't recommend this unless you like having a crappy cheap phone or just for a backup. there was no user guide and the phone looked like it was used. Didn't expect it to be that big and with very crappy ring tones. I got this item thinking it would work like my old razr...boy was I wrong!!...you will miss text and you will not be able to receive pictures. I bought a ten dollar gophone from at&t that does a better than this thing. So like I said...don't waste your money. I ordered a unlocked cellphone because one of my phones was having problems when I dropped it. It toils not work the same however THE phone Amazon send me was a prepaid phone but I just needed a unlocked phone too transfer all my info to. When I ordered my phone I was very thorough in telling the agent what I needed. However I'm reading this service unsatisfactory because of what they sent RECIEVED ON TIME BACK COVER WAS BROKEN ASKED FOR ANOTHER ONE AND THEY SENT ME A PINK COVER SERIOUSLY WTH THE THE HONE IT SELF STOP WORKING WITHIN A FEW WEEKS HORRIBLE DONT WWASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ITH THESE PEOPLE VERY UNPROFESSIONAL. Nice looking phone.\n",

The Reseller I used, Unlimited Phones 4 Less, is not a good company to deal with, and I am sorry to say Amazon did nothing to help me get a refund or phones returned.  Now I have 2 Motorola RAZR V3 phones that don't work, and I am out my money. Don't think that just because I had a problem you won't, because you will.  Don't buy this phone. They dealer sent me a box with one piece of bubble wrap!?!? Do not order from them!!!!! How do they not know they are sending out an empty box? You can feel it when you are holding an empty box! Purchased two of these phones one in black the other in pink.  Have now had to return both of them for not working correctly.  Don't waste your time with these.  The ones we received were crap.  Black one - center arrow buttons would not work correctly.  Pink one - tried to make a phone call and they could hear me I could not hear them, it would not make phone calls correctly.  And the battery seemed like it did not fit right and the back cover would not lock down right. Phone headset volume would not work.  Too much trouble and shipping cost to send it back. This was is a bad phone. It worked for a short time. Then, it stopped working in a bad location and my husband was unable to reach me. This was supposed to be a new phone, not a reconditioned phone. I am very disappointed with this phone. My husband loved the Motorola RAZR V3 phone and was looking forward to using this phone. Says it can be used with AT&T !!!!!!!

It worked for a month then stopped finally got the phone after waiting 3 weeks...remember this seller is from china...and no the phone will not take a charge...the battery upon closer inspection is cracked...nice..i haven't even been able to use the phone yet...will order new battery...this seller is suspect...the phone looks good but the seller shipped the item with the battery in the phone>>>not to thrilled about this purchase... This phone is crap, I wish I could give it zero stars. First of all, it is not a US version, as it claims. The language is European English. I have owned other razor phones, and bought this for my fiance, who loved the two he had, that just wore out over time. The settings are all completely different. Will not send texts properly, nor receive them, using the same T-Mobile service as on a previous RAZR V3. Will also not send nor receive picture messages. Cannot find a mode for predictive text messaging. And, the case doesn't even fit properly on the phone. I found out that these phones are factory refurbished in China, when I took it to a phone repair shop I go to regularly, and fully trust. It is absolutely awful. Do not buy this phone, it is a complete ripoff. Junk!! Got it new and stopped working a week later:( I was very happy with the quick delivery and the product. However; approximately 1.5 weeks later the phone was defective and not working. This is the reason why I gave the product a low rating. Two months later, the phone is dead and will not charge. It is going to cost too much to send it back so i will just accept my losses. they send us a phone and the screen does not even come on\n",
      "IT LOOKED GOOD ON THE PICTURE BUT NOT WHEN WE GOT IT I returned it. Later learned that internet access settings have to be properly configured for US to send pictures. Perhaps this was not done.. unfortunately, this phone is much more flimsy than I would have thought. the sound quality is awful and I can barely hear the voicemail messages when I play them, it cuts in and out so much. It feels very plasticky and seems to be coming apart at the seams. This is not a reflection of the seller at all, I just think this phone is not a very good product I am going to return phone it will not stay charged for more than an hour, that's the only problem so far but unable to use for extended time to see if there are any other issues. THE PHONE WOULD NOT WORK. IT KEPT ON LOOSING SERVICE. WOUD NOT WORK PROPERLY. I PURCHASED 2 OF THE UNLOCKED PHONES AND NEITHER ONE OF THEM WOULD WORK. Bought this phone because it said it was compatible with my in car system.  The phone came from italy , not the US so its all messed up.  Battery life is maybe 2 hours talk time and 10 hours stsndby.  Wound up trashing it and recycling the battery.  Good for nothing...  this is where they get that phrase from. I used it for about two hours but I couldn't stand the bubles between the screen and the screen protector. The more I tried to clean it the worst it got, so I tossed it that same day. Item arrived cracked at the hinge so I sent it back and went on using my otterbox. I have a pelican backpack no problem with that this seemed to have just been a bad seller. Is the worse company on the market to buy products !!\n",
      "Trust me Do not buy from this company, make sure you read the FINE PRINT (wich I never Saw it), I bought a product from them and I try to return it and I got and stupid answer from them, after 3 attempts. I will call BBB for this company, and thats a promise. I've replaced this item long ago, surprisingly with another Jawbone product that works well.  Hopefully, you will not find this original vintage anymore. This arrived from Tiger Direct a few days after my order, not as fast as direct from Amazon but okay. The unit would not operate at all. (White LED stayed on; headset would not pair with the cell phone or turn on or off.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I called Aliph and returned it to them for warranty swap, a somewhat unpleasant but ultimately satisfactory process. No one could understand what I was saying! This was a used headset, so perhaps something was wrong with just this unit. The reviews on the H700 were okay, but THIS particular one was useless. It also looked somewhat beat up when I received it. Right from the start people were saying that we had a bad connection. Most people said that they just couldn't understand me. With some, I would end the call then call again with my friends Bluetooth and they would say \"That's MUCH better!\". I explained this to the  BooksExpress610 rep and was told \"This unit was tested by our trained staff prior to being listed on Amazon. The report we have that it was in perfect working order. If you would like go ahead and return it to us however a restocking fee will be charged by BooksExpress610.\"  I then asked how much and was told \"We will not know how much the restocking fee is going to be until we see the product and the condition of it. It also depends on if you return the provided accessories with it (USB cable) restocking fee is between 5%-15%.\"  So, I shipped it back in the exact condition it was shipped to me in, with the USB cable, and, of course, they charged me the full 15%! I will avoid Books Express610 for anything in the future! They were not in the least bit concerned with customer satisfaction. As I told them, I REALLY wanted to love this headset! Now I don't know what to get for a Bluetooth headset as I had really high hopes for the H700. NEVER WORK, DONT BUY, THIS IS SALVAGE PRODUCT O R DEFECTIVE LOT OF PRODUCT, NO WONDER THE LOW PRICE. WATCH OUT DONT BUY!! I just received the headset last night. I was happy with the size- it's smaller than I thought and super lightweight. I charged it all night and the green light came on. But then- that's it. When I unplug it from the charger nothing happens- no lights turn on no matter what I do. I went to the troubleshooting motorola website which is a complete waste. They have no information there at all. Will be returning it. When I searched google for info on what to do, I found that most people have some kind of problem be it not turning on, disconnecting or losing power. Bluetooth has lots of static as well as volume changing quite frequently. On top of this battery only lasts 8 hrs with about 20 minutes of talk time. Vendor has reassured me they are sending me a replacement. Have not recieved it yet but being optimistic. I would NOT purchase this product off of the internet.  I ordered one, recieved it, and it wouldn't even register that it was charging, so I didn't get to test it.  I called Amazon, and they were great.  The representative was kind and he quickly sent me a replacement item overnight.  I opened that one up and it did charge.  I had some trouble pairing it with my phone, but it did eventually do that.  Then I tried to use it.  When I put it in the \"on\" position, it turned off.  When I put it in the \"off\" position, it turned on.  I even took it to a brick and mortar store to make sure I wasn't missing something.  I did purchase one from that store, the H710, the next model up, and I have to say that I do like it.  It works great and is very comfortable on my ear.  There also seems to be a bit of a quality discrepency between the two virtually identical items.\n",
      "The one I purchased at the store is a lot less \"plasticky\" than the one I ordered on-line.  It just seems less-than-coincidental that i recieved two in a row that were malfunctioning significantly. This doesn't work. Save your money. Does not work as a factory (Samsung) charger. It took forever to charge my phone, and not worth the aggravation Item not as described!  The description says this is a ECC1DS2UBE, which according to Samsung is a charge & sync cable.  The cable actually shipped by Seller1ON1 is a different model number and cannot be used for charging.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cable they ship can be used for sync or data transfer, but cannot charge your phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Choose another vendor who ships what they advertise. I didn't really expect too much from this case, and my expectations were fully met. If it fit a little tighter on the phone, I think it would work a tad better. There is no way you can access the charging port or SD card with this case on. It's just not well made. I got this phone through T-mobile's upgrade service.  The first unit they sent me seemed to have a lot of problems, so I sent it back and received another one.  The second unit had the exact same problems, which tells me that the phone is defective and it wasn't just a bum unit.  Again, these problems existed on TWO brand new pearl 8120s, so it wasn't a fluke:\n",
      "\n",
      "Show-stopping problems:\n",
      "- The battery cover is loose!  The cover does not sit snugly on the back of the phone, and it rattles around when you hold the phone to your ear.  People on the other end of the line complained about hearing a rattling noise.\n",
      "- Wi-Fi interferes with your phone call.  I was very excited that this phone could connect to Wi-Fi, but it turned out to be a drag.  Any time the phone was downloading data (new Emails, messages, etc), if you were talking on the phone at the same time, the voice on the other end would sputter and lag until the data transfer was done.  This could last up to a minute or more each time.\n",
      "- The operating system is unstable.  The very first day I had this phone, I was on a conference call for work and had the unit on speakerphone.  A couple of minutes into the call, the phone crashed and rebooted itself!  And this phone takes several minutes to boot up, so I missed a lot of my conference call.  The phone crashed/rebooted about once a day for the entire time I had it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other cons:\n",
      "- Weak battery life.  With mixed web browsing and talking, the battery lasted just over a day.\n",
      "- Web browsing.  Even when using my wireless internet and NOT EDGE, the browser would time-out or stall when loading web pages.  It often took me two or three attempts to load web pages.\n",
      "- Poor choices for ring tones / wall papers / themes.\n",
      "- Phone feels weak and flimsy to the touch.  If you drop it, you can kiss your new phone goodbye.\n",
      "- The 2 MP camera took mediocre pictures even in direct sunlight.  Also, E-mailing those pictures (when taken at full resolution) essentially disables your phone until the Email upload is complete.  The phone becomes unresponsive and all you see is the hourglass waiting icon, for several minutes per picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "- Very light phone\n",
      "- T-mobile didn't hassle me about returning both units when I was very unhappy with my new phone.\n",
      "- Good voice quality (when not interfered by Wi-Fi or incoming messages)\n",
      "- The SureType technology was nice for sending messages.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cons FAR OUTWEIGH the pros.  I was extremely disappointed by this phone because I heard such great things about the previous version, the Pearl 8100.  The 8120 is flimsy, has manufacturing defects, and is very unreliable.  I'll never buy another blackberry again. While I thought my fingers would be too big to use with the iPhone text keys, and I do occasionally bring up the wrong letter, it works well +90% of the time.  I thought I could improve with the stylus.  The lightest touch with my finger works and works instantly.  The stylus was cumbersome, you have to push hard and long.  It made the process much more cumbersome and tiresome compared to using fingers and therefor was not worth the small increase in accuracy of typing.  The screen protector had a tab of paper glued to it to purportedly help you with placement.  However, when you pulled the tab of paper off, it left a big glob of glue that would not come off.  Bottom line, both the protective shield and the stylus are in the trash. I thought that the mount was a flexible snake, but found that instead, the snake is rigid plastic.  I could not find any way to mount it in my car such that it looked reasonable.  Ended up not using it, and buying a mount that attached to the ventilator pieces, which worked a great deal better and looked better too.  It was made by the same company.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think anyone would buy this thing if they realized that the snake is not flexible. It worked for only 1 day.  The first sign of trouble was on day 2 when it stopped syncing up with my wife's cell phone and we could not use our home phone to receive or dial-out using her cell phone even though we had not moved her cell phone outside the range of the gateway. On day 3 I noticed that the blue cell phone synch indicator light and red power indicator light were off.  I checked the connection and it was still plugged in.  I then unplugged the gateway and tried another known good power outlet, but still no power light on the gateway.  Apparently it died after only 2 days!  I can't believe that GE has their name on this product.  I will be returning it and will not be getting a replacement.  Although it is twice the price I am considering the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/XLink-Cellular-Bluetooth-Gateway-With-Land-Line-Connection/dp/B00164H7DC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">XLink Cellular Bluetooth Gateway With Land Line Connection</a>&nbsp;to see if I get better results. It came relatively quickly. Set-up went easily. But when there was an incoming call, neither could we get the plugged-in house phone to answer, nor our cell phone. We had to note the number that was calling and then call them back. The house phone would make a call out, but only after entering a code. We were unable to get the device to work with other phones on the in-house wiring system. After a week and several re-hook-ups, we threw in the towel and now just use the cell phone by itself. Made of cheap material....busted after two weeks of use,I would not buy again, bummer . . . . . . Belt clip broke too fast I've used mine for less than a month and it is falling apart in two places. In fact, I have had to stop using it because of the risk of it falling off my belt. The metal clip is too sharp and was ruining belts, so I used the belt loop instead. That makes the metal clip dig in to my side unless I place it carefully, and the clip on the inside puts pressure on the belt loop, which has made it split.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't waste your money on this. This product look great out of the box but a month later the nylon loops that hold the clip and the belt loop is unraveling and  part of the nylon is loose and flapping. this won't last another month. Fell apart within days. Material shredded and seems feel apart. I loved the look of it and the option of horizontal or vertical. But horrible manufacturing. Horrible. I should have listened to other reviewers. I can't believe this product is still offered. My dog ate it before I could send it back. they must be second as the belt loop always come undid sewing Poor quality.,  lasted 2 months Do not get this If you plan on wearing. Protect is great. and start coming apart I wear this on the belt loop and the loop for the belt just got torned and ripped in just 2-months. Not worth the money. It ripped easily. Very weak construction.  Multiple belt system in weak cloth and poor stitching causes the case to tear almost immediately.  A great design, very very poor implementation.  I had to sew mine several times to keep it from falling apart and am just going to replace it now.\n",
      "Avoid this manufacturer excellent concept with the metal clip. But not a good idea as it pretty much eats away at the belt loop its attached too and then it falls apart and becomes useless. Did not last that long. Quality is not that great. If you work in Construction, this is not the phone pouch for you. I have had this for about 2 weeks and the metal clip was coming off.  I then switched to the belt loop and the stiching came apart within days.  Too bad it fits the phone nicely, but the rest is crap.  I have a Reiko cell phone case for my work IPhone (simalar to this) and that works great, if I can find one for the Note 3 I am getting it.  Stay away from this. The threading on the belt loop holder became loose (about 25%) after about 2 months or light use. That made the case completely unusable. I uploaded a picture of the problem after I tore the holder all the way off to illustrate the poor stitching.\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE:\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered and received a new case&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-II-2-N7100-I605-L900-I317-T889-Tmobile-All-Version-Reiko-Black-Leather-Pouch-Case-Cover-with-Belt-Clip-Holster-and-Loops/dp/B009RFC4IU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Samsung Galaxy Note II 2 N7100 I605 L900 I317 T889 Tmobile All Version Reiko Black Leather Pouch Case Cover with Belt Clip Holster and Loops</a>. My Galaxy Note 2 with Zerolemon battery fits nugly within this case and the magnetic holder just closes. It takes a bit of effort to extract the phone from the case, but I think it will work fine once the faux leather expands a bit. In terms of construction, the clip mechanism appears to be strong and durable. For belt use, there are actually 3 loop sections; I would be very surprised if they tore off with normal use. If there is any weakness (TBD), it might be in the stitched elastic sections that expand to accommodate wider phones. Time will tell... This holster appears at first to be strong and durable, and for the most part the case itself is quite strong, but within two days of normal use (no abuse) the stitching that secures the top of the metal clip ripped, causing the holster to hang outward at an odd angle, which then caused it to catch on various things and cause the stitching to tear even more.  This happened with two holsters purchased from two suppliers, so I know it isn't a fluke.  You'll have better luck if you use the belt loop, but then you'll have a metal clip pressing into your hip on the inside of the belt, which can be uncomfortable.  Also, if you like to wear your phone vertically the holster holds the phone a little too high (I believe this is to balance the phone when worn horizontally), which is part of why the phone tends to hang outward.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a couple weeks the stitching around the belt clip continued to unravel, and there is a design flaw in the belt loop (the loop is actually a two layer loop where the inside layer allows you to wear the phone on its side, and the outer loop, which is sewn on top of the inner one, supports the clip and allows you to wear the phone upright) that makes the holster hang too loose to allow vibrations from the phone to be felt by the wearer.  The vibrator in the Note 2 phone is already way too weak, so when the holster design doesn't allow for efficient transfer of the vibrations you might as well have your phone set to silent because you'll never feel a call coming in.  I have to manually check the phone every few minutes to see if any calls or texts came in, and I can't count the calls that I've missed since using this holster.  I tried re-stitching the clip and outer loop directly to the case (basically got rid of the loops), and while that helped a lot it's a lot of trouble to go through.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, while it's a nice feature that this holster has enough interior space to accommodate a bulky case on the phone, it also means that if you don't have a bulky case the phone will flop around in the holster so you won't be able to feel the vibrator very well. Looks great even fits the note with a cover on it, but the clip ripped from the pouch after only one week of use. Its a waste of time and Money..... The Jawbone bluetooth headset is not really made very well and is a lot worse than people seem to give it credit for. Parts fall off after a short time and it is very cheaply made. It looks metal but really is cheap bendy plastic material.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, once you set it up, you can only use it on one ear. Other headsets (like Plantronics ones for example) allow you to swivel the earloop to switch ears if you get tired of using it on one ear. The Jawbone doesn't do this.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the Jawbone's noise cancellation does seem good that's about all it has going for it because your voice still sounds muffled, soft and digital-like. Further, the Jawbone is too big and bulky to comfortably put it into a pocket to take with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "But my main complaint is with the Aliph Jawbone company customer service itself-they are absolutely horrible. They advertise on their website that the Jawbone has a 1 year manufacture warranty to the end consumer. But, my Jawbone broke and when I contacted them about getting warranty service on it, they rudely informed me that they only provide warranties on units bought directly from their own website. If I bought from some other retailer, it has ZERO warranty! I'm not sure whether or not this is even legal since I'm not a lawyer, but do believe it reflects very poorly on the company that they don't even stand behind their own products.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would never recommend buying this headset or any other made by Aliph. I had high hopes for this but was let down hard. It sounded like I was inside a tin can. I tried it with the Noise Shield on and off but no difference. The caller on the other end didn't notice that effect but the removal of background noise for them was no better than my favorite, the Plantronics Voyager 510. The other big issue was the fit. The ear loop is slightly spring loaded to keep the mouthpiece sensor pressing against your cheek. This is intended to allow the sensor to differentiate between your voice and the background sounds. The problem was that the spring tension of the ear loop was slightly pushing the headset off my ear. It comes with several ear bud sizes and two ear loop sizes. I tried them all, on both ears. No luck. It was held on so loosely that the slightest lean of my head to that side and off it came. Completely unacceptable and far worse than all the others I've tried. I have tested 8 different headsets. The way I do my tests is to pair two headsets, put one in each ear, and then switch between them while on the same call. Even if I ignore the fit problem (a deal breaker for me) the sound quality was poor. Worse for me than the caller but why bother, I'll stick with my 510. I purchased this headset with high expectations.  I took my time.  I compared and contrasted.  I read all the reviews.  I thought I had made a great purchase.\n",

      "Unfortunately, the ergonomic design of this headset does not match the electronic design.  I can't believe how badly Aliph missed the mark with this headset!\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the good.  The sound from this headset rocks!  The noise mitigating technology is great.  I work in computer data centers the noise level often fluctuates.  The set adjusts both the sound heard by the other listener and the volume that I hear.  It still has very poor quality in windy environments, but I don't know of a set that doesn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the bad.  This headset wouldn't be allowed in Guantanamo Bay.  It is pure torture to wear.  The various combinations of ear bud and ear loop just gives you more ways to inflict pain on your ears.  I can't wear the headset for more than about 10-15 minutes, and sometimes end calls due to the uncomfortable feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "I used to put the set in my pocket between calls.  Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.  I contacted the company and they indicates that this is because if the loop doesn't break, the headset itself would break instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company told me I could \"gently\" bend the loops to fit my ear better.  They also recommended Jabra ear gels instead of the Aliph ear buds.  They also recommended a place that can make a custom gel earbud (for about $65 + shipping).\n",

      "As long as you sty away from all the Non warranty products U R SAFE. IF YOU WEAR THIS DEVICE, YOU WILL HEAVE YOUR EARS BLISTER OR TURN RED. IT HURT SO BAD AFTER A FEW MINUTES WEARING IT. I HAVE TO ADMIT, IT LOOK LIKE THE 60 STYLE EAR MUFF Not the original one. Very bad product. To fragile. Is broken already only last week and half.  Fraud product. Bad quality. Not recommend to any one. Amazon don't advertise i bought this phone for my daughter for when she had sleepovers and school functions. However i thought i was safe with the pay as you go... we bought a $10.00 card for her, and used it a few times... still had a balance, however the fine print said that it uses $.35 per day if you use the phone or NOT. Thus sucked up our $10.00. When I called to place money on the card a couple of months later, found out that since we have not used the phone in over 30 days, and the account had a balance of 0 for 30 days, we had to buy a new sim card costing $9.95 plus pay for extra minutes. This IS NOT WORTH IT! You are better off adding a family line at $9.95 a month, and using your AT&T or T-mobile sim card and plan. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME like i did! Also their customer service SUCKS... For a plan designed for kids, the service is designed to trap you to keep pouring money into their account, not as an alternative family friendly phone for kids. This is the most painful headset I've ever used. The sound quality is no big deal either. The fact that it is not easy to put on and take off quickly makes it so you have to keep it on if you don't want to miss a call. But keeping it on for a couple of hours caused me pain no matter which size ear pad I used. The charger is only for home, so no quick charge in the car in any emergency. The Jawbone is much better for comfort and I've had no problems with it at all as far as sound quality. The jawbone charger is its weak link, however, as with time it becomes loose and difficult to connect to the device.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd stick to the old H700, with good noise control, great comfort and the ability to charge anywhere. I bought this product with high hopes and high expectations. After a few weeks, it started having alot of static, battery life was terrible, and the range was terrible. I am trying to return this product right now. I am very dissapointed. I bought this headset for my wife. She can't use this unit because it constantly falls off of her ear(no bud for ear.)I use it as a backup in the car when my jawbone battery is drained. The sound quality is choppy. The only good point is it syncs very quickly with my cell phone and the flip mic feature is convenient. I would recommend Jawbone, Plantronics, or Jabra well before this unit. This headset wasn't the best quality - it was great for me, the talker, but the mic didn't work so well. The person on the other end often had a hard time hearing me when I was talking in a quiet environment (forget it when in the car!). I'd recommend something else. Sound started cutting out after just a couple weeks. Threw it away Will not stay in headphone jack I purchased 3 of these through the seller WELLGOAL. Each had faulty and misaligned connectors, resulting in messed up audio. If you've ever pulled your headphone plug out slightly, and only heard echoey background music without the vocals, it sounded like that. All 3 were also slightly different lengths (bad quality control?). The adapters did not work on the following devices: iPod Nano 4th Gen, Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, iPod Touch 4th Gen, Kindle Fire HD.\n",
      "\n",
      "I contacted WELLGOAL for a refund, but they insisted these adapters were ONLY FOR iPHONE 3G AND 3GS, and thus were not defective. If I wanted to return them, they said I had to pay for return shipping and restocking fees. I balked, and they offered me a 20% refund if I simply kept them. I ended up doing that, as it was the cheapest option. But I will be avoiding WELLGOAL from here on out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also - BEWARE of re-ordering an item from your past orders. I had initially purchased a similar item from X-eParts (aka, eForCity), which worked GREAT with my devices. I wanted to order more of those. However, since the seller no longer carries the item, Amazon quietly shuffled me off to a different item with a different seller. That's a little deceptive. its a very good price. but you will find it does nothing.\n",
      "I needed a way to put a large headphone plug into a tiny jack hole. this is not what i expected it to be. really there are nicer tools for you to get nearly as inexpensive this is not the tool you want! This thing did not work at all. Don't waste your money. It was a cheap piece of crap. Buy somewhere else. Its has already had a wire broke some where inside the covering, had to throw away, not worth sending back These things got such bad reviews - that I ordered 3 just to be sure I got one good one (at least they're cheap). I gave them two stars instead of one since, oddly, 2 of 3 of them worked for their intended purpose (a size adapter for my iPhone), though none of them work when plugged into my PC. Hard to imagine this is a very difficult product to manufacture - so I just assume the manufacturer could simply care less...\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE: Turns out my 2 star review was way too generous. All 3 of these eventually stopped working properly. A truly staggering level of apathy by the manufacturer... I bought this for my original 2007 iPhone.  The one with the recessed headphone jack.  Remember that?  You had to use the then-new super-skinny headphone jack that came on the apple earbuds, or buy an adapter.  Well, the product description said it fit (it was later changed).  I contacted the company to complain, and they said I'd have to pay to return the item, which cost more than buying a new one.  So I threw it out.  Too bad.  Waste of time and money. This is very flimsy, both connectors and the cable.  Mine only works if you wiggle the phone end and hold it just right.  Obviously pretty worthless like that.  Forget buying this one, even if it works when you first get it don't expect it to last more than one or two uses. I bought several of these as a workaround for cases that have too narrow a plug hole on the iphone5 I also started using them to protect constant unplugging of my itouch & headphone jacks that were too large. After a few days one side shorted out & it was the adapter connection that had frayed even though it was never removed by wire-always carefully handled...i replaced it w a new spare but several weeks of trying to figure out what the sound quality problems were with new headphones and whether it was a ripping/ download setting....finally discovered the distortion & thin sound was this adapter!! I used another since i had  a third i had yet to use and same result!! These are crappy sounding adapters that might allow you to plug in a headphone for a week or less but also GREATLY compromising sound quality! Does not give you Left and Right channels like it should. Music in unbearable and incorrect. Do not buy this. You cannot use the remote controls with this case on iPhone.  I got mine from elago.  Every vendor may be different.  The annoying part is that they are all under the same item and there is no way to figure out unless you buy it. Purchased 2 of this item to use with iPhone 5.  Neither work appropriately.  They alternate between making popping sounds through the speakers or transmitting only the left channel. Not adaptable for Square credit card swipe. Adaptable only for headphone. Need more information on the website guideline on this product. It works but not for what I needed it for. The female end is thicker than the picture. This does not work where I needed it, where only apple size jack would fit. Sure there are three rings on the male end, but there are only two wires on the inside of the cable and female side.\n",

      "I wish I could offer zero stars. So I lost the adapter that came with the Lifeproof case and was really being cheap when I ordered this one. I learned the lesson the hard way :(.  The seller is not at fault here, I actually received my item way ahead of schedule.  The sounds comes through really strange, like its an echo from inside a tin can.  Tried with multiple earbuds/headphones and the problem persisted.  Just go with the real lifeproof adapter if you can find one in stock. Purchased from Eforcity, US seller that I've gotten a few items from before and quality was good for the price.  Not this case.  Item is the proper fit, and fits bumper cases or special cases that would only accept an Apple headphone jack (ie thin).\n",
      "\n",
      "But, at first, I was getting audio from just one channel - Jiggling a bit the cable at the base of the male end, 2nd channel started working but was getting static noise by just moving the cable.\n",

      "Audio would then come and go, by briefly moving the cable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Filed claim for damaged item.  Seems to me a $1.70 down the drain. The adapter is wired for something other than an iPhone. The sound is distorted and the microphone does not work with the standard earbud headset that comes with the iPhone. If you hold the pause button the sound comes through correctly which indicates that the wires are crossed in the adapter. I received the item pictured but it doesn't work at all! No sound comes through it at all, even if you use the Apple headphones with it!  Don't bother wasting your money on it. It worked only for two months then stopped working, well, it works on one side only, the other earphone get no sound. I thought I would need one of these for my iPhone in order to use a headset with a normal 1/4 inch jack. WRONG! my Sony's work just fine without this convertor. Don't waste your money, not that it's a lot, you just don't need one.... this is borderline trash. it works just enough, and just long enough to make you thing youve got a bargain. but then, you get sound from one earphone only. or none. depending on the velocity of a butterfly's wings in china. don't buy this unless you like to be disappointed. I purchased this item and it would not work when the headphone was plugged in all the way...the sound was muffled.  But it worked fine when the headphone was plugged in 3/4 of the way.  Eforcity sent me a replacement at no charge but unfortunately the replacement doesn't work at all. Beware, you will not get the item that is pictured.  You will get some sort of iPhone recessed port adapter (kinda like the Belkin one) but not nearly as good as the one in the picture.\n",

      "Tells you what kind of seller you're dealing with. Cannot keep the wire connected to my phone. these things are good, for about a week. These would have to be used in a stationary application where they will never be touched because when I use it with my iPhone, as gently as I possibly can, the cable starts to short out. At first I lose the microphone, then I lose theory and the ability to change volume, then lastly the audio goes out and it's over, a generally I throw it away at step one (after troubleshooting it, of course) nope.. don't fit my apple iphone as advertised.. too much trouble to send em back...\n",
      "but not super happy.. Used it the first time and it shorted out the AUX port on an iPhone 5S.  Will be returning it and now replacing an iPhone.  Sticking with the original Mophie adapter when I get a new phone. The cable rubber part is way too thick! I wanted to use it for my extended battery...and it doesn't fit! The description said that it will fit even with a case, and its not true. The picture don't matches with the product delivered. It will not work for my purpose. It is a regular extension of a headphone. I was looking for an extension that had a jack as the apple headphone jack. Does not look like the picture, barly fits with my iphone case. The end came with some paint/whiteout on the end which comes off on your hands and on my phone case. Useless and doesn't work for plugging in paypal pay here. Why make a product that doesn't work? These are single channel audio. it will not allow sound from both channels. It would be good if they were removed from the site because they are not a compatable with apple iPhone for audio and therefore false advertising. It will not play full audio and it is not compatable with accessories. don't waste your money I bought this to work with the Thermodo temperature gadget so I could keep my iPhone case ON my iPhone and not have to remove it. This 3.5mm headphone adapter makes temperature readings with the Thermodo about 20 F lower than that it reds without the 3.5mm headphone adapter. 1.

      "Alright Ive used this guitar for about 3-4 weeks its extremely uncomfortable to play when sitting down so this would only be comfortable to play while standing up with a strap on bottom line is the guitar looks \"cool\" at first but at this price a lot of kids will be buying this guitar thus making the unique look it has not so unique so if you buying this for the looks save your money its uncomfortable as hell to play while sitting down This board is a total waste of money.\n",
      "i went through 2 in about 5 months but the 18 inch crash ride wen used as a ride cymbal has lasted me about a year and a half with only 1 small crack that hasn't grew and my hi-hats still sound that same way as when i took them out of the box same with m 16 inch zbt crash.....the only cymbal from the zbt line i hate is the 14\" if u want a good cymbal for a cheap price buy the 16\" the 14 \" failed miserably Bars are square and thin.\n",
      "phone case does not work.\n",
      "When I first got this it worked good but I noticed that my galaxy was not charging like it was in the first stages of this purchase.\n",
      "My primary purpose for the purchase was to sync the pictures and music from my phone, which the product does not work for.\n",
      "It's not even enough to charge the HTC One, My phone always display \"Charging Slow\" The battery worked just fine, started draining faster after like 6 months.\n",
      "battery didn't last too long It doesn't last like as a 7800 mah battery should, I have to charge my phone twice a day with light use This setup doesn't last much longer than the thin battery.\n",
      "have tried several phones with these, non responded to a signal difference with them...would not buy again...worthless waste of money for me...\n",
      "Didn't see any difference in reception of the antennae on my cell phone It's one of those things you know in your heart isn't going to work.\n",
      "I am hoping they last a good long time, because I am very, very happy with them and feel like I have FINALLY come to the end of my long search for the perfect earbuds to wear at work.\n",
      "Never worked  and I should have known better, don't waste your time just get a better phone or service a waste.\n",
      "A definite \"don't buy\" Perhaps I just got a bad one, but this thing won't consistently work 4 feet away from the phone, let alone the 30 they claim.\n",
      "I've tried many combinations of phone and headset, and the only time I have problem is with this headset, so I'm quite sure it's not an issue with my phone, or with bluetooth in general.\n",
      "PHONE WORKED FOR 2 WEEKS...DISSAPOINTED :( junk Its stopped working after an year use.\n",
      "It is beautiful and has great features but it keeps failing I have had 5 of these phones so far (the original purchased one plus 4 refurbished replacements) 1st phone: after a couple of months the screen would not light up / 2nd phone would not charge from the get go / 3rd phone after about a month the screen would no longer light up / 4th phone after a couple of months the screen would not light up / 5th phone has been working for about a month now.\n",
      "I really like the RAZR phones, WHEN THEY WORK but this V3 model has been terrible and I would rate it lower than 1 star if possible.\n",
      "If you want any mobility to roam around the house and get good signal don't waste your money on this, if you are stationary with your phone or tether it to your desktop then this would work for you.\n",
      "did not worked I bought this one because i miss the old slim fones and bored of the big tablets and phablets of noawadays but i regret wasting money on this product because refurbished can never be as good as new or even close to it: many functions not working, buttons jammed, speakers damaged,,etc NEVER WORK, DONT BUY, THIS IS SALVAGE PRODUCT O R DEFECTIVE LOT OF PRODUCT, NO WONDER THE LOW PRICE.\n",
      "Has good looks and size, special features not compatible with smartphones like treo palm, must have a motorola phone for it to work good, battery lifecycle not good, used it for about 3 months and battery never worked again :( Once I received my headset and read the instructions, I proceeded to charge it using the charger that came with it.\n",
      "got the screen to change colors and call different people from her contacts, tried drying and then it stopped even working as even a phone, it would go to the tracfone turn on screen reset itself and do it again until you did something like press a button itd go off, or the battery would die.\n",
      "Bought the Jabra 125 and love it I have owned the headset for over 2 months and the battery life is very very poor and it does fall out of the ear from time to time but i can deal with that and not the battery life, you will be lucky if it gives you an hour of talk time, do your self a favor and don't waste your money, yes it looks very sleek and nice but if i knew the battery life is this bad i would have never spend the money.\n",
      "Like all other reviewers with the Krzr k1m phones said, this product does not work with it.\n",
      "I tried it with the 2.5mm plug adaptor (part # SYN1505A) that comes with the Krzr k1m phone, and the LG headset works great with the k1m.\n",
      "I contacted motorola about this product and they said it's NOT made for these phones and that I needed the 2.5 mm headset adapter (no microphone support) to use with my krzr k1m phone.\n",
      "DO NOT BUY I bought two, but they sent three; took 4 weeks to get in mail, as they'd warned when purchasing; wrapped up to look like OEM, but I'm thinking it's a fake; people selling it certainly haven't responded to my complaints;  works no longer than my 4 and 6 year old OEM batteries scavenged from other folks dead Moto V3 RAZRs.\n",
      "there are 2 d&g as anne said, black and gold which is the limited edition one and the mass production one, i just bought this one but unfortunately its not in a perfect or new condition some dirt on it, the color is faded and is almost gone from the side buttons, doesnt close welland a white label inside the body trying to cover the original fone information, the assemblying is very poor, i love motorola, never had this problem, please be aware of thi, i think it's refabrished or something, missing features, buttom line DONT BUY IT FROM HERE i would sell mine for 10$ without shipping however i just got today.:S I wanted to use rechargeables (good performance and inexpensive) and keep this in my briefcase as a backup charger.\n",
      "I've always had good luck with Motorola products previously, but i suspect the mouthpiece on the phone i got is defective.\n",
      "The only reason I didn't return it is because i didn't want to be stuck without a phone for another week, and it (mostly) works as long as i use it with the ear-bud.\n",
      "The good news is this phone seems to have dropped in price like a rock, so maybe you can buy it for what it is actually worth.\n",
      "the battery on this phone is terrible...evewryday i'm charging it, and the reception is very poor.....i miss my nokia If I have to buy an extra speaker to be able to hear OnStar instead of it going through the factory speakers this thing is pointless.\n",
      "I buyed this item, i don't recomended, because,after feww days use, the stickers does`nt work, and you can hold the phone, not good.\n",
      "If you phone doesn't have such a connection, then you may want to look into a different phone because nothing without a direct connection is going to work, and you may want to look into a phone that gets better reception (there are some -- just read the 3rd party reviews).\n",
      "Broke my holster to my outterbox, so I thought I'd switch up and just when I did, my phone broke away fell and my screen cracked.....no good I have been searching high and low for a quality case for my note 2.\n",
      "I bought this item after i forgot to add it to my unlocked phone purchase and it was a waste because you cannot use this sim without giving your credit card, which means that even if you only want incoming calls you still need to register.\n",
      "I got this sim card as a free promo item with the purchase of a cell phone, the rates for this service are really nuts, I probably won't use it.\n",
      "After a few days one side shorted out & it was the adapter connection that had frayed even though it was never removed by wire-always carefully handled...i replaced it w a new spare but several weeks of trying to figure out what the sound quality problems were with new headphones and whether it was a ripping/ download setting....finally discovered the distortion & thin sound was this adapter!!\n",
      "So, if any using spigen phone case and wanted to use this adapter for putting aux then this will not work Product does not work as described.\n",
      "Crappiest product on the market I bought this and the second day it lost signal do not buy this ever Did not work well at all, was so quite I could not listen to anything.\n",
      "I ordered this kind from a diferent seller and when arrive top fron where it folds over the plastic underneath is always coming apart as was the same problem with this seller seems to be a manafacturer issue so i wouldn't recommend this item the vinyl may be better and have less chance of this issue but no more will i buy this item fro mthis seler or any other seller as i am closing amazon account out because too many sellers having issues reviews will be posted about this item ands sellers online review sites I purchased this item and was very disappointed because this is not the cable I was looking for.\n",
      "I tried the strategy, and it works After years of being tethered to my cordless phone in order to use a headset, I finally gave in and decided to try the Calisto.\n",
      "This looked like an interesting and relatively low-cost option for my wife's car/cell phone, since she hasn't found a bluetooth headset that fits her ear comfortably.\n",
      "Since I purchased this to charge my iPhone, my work phone (galacy s6) and my kindle in the middle compartment, I won't be able to use it.\n",
      "That's enough tries, I am now going to look for a different product that likely will not fit needs as well as this one should have.\n",
      "The only good thing about this phone is the camera, but i didn't buy the phone to take pictures, i bought it to make calls.\n",
      "UP DATE  pops off never got to use it but a couple of times for an hr or so, Dont waste money or time on it This NO is exactly what I was looking for - This NO is exactly what I was looking for - I got this for my iphone, and again ship on time, love that, but it dose not stay put  in my car, so no good.\n",
      "I really wanted this to work but it never charged my phone for more than 2 minutes.\n",
      "Do not waste your money or time with this product if my experience is typical:  this took an initial charge, I used it to re-charge my ipad (and it was incredibly slow and did not fully re-charge the ipad), then re-charged the device, got all the lights, stored it, and then went to use it in a week, and it had no charge, and wouldn't take a charge.\n",
      "I could hear them they couldn't hear me thought it might be muted but called motorola  they said needed to be replaced .It may have been great if I could have got it to work wouldn't stay connected to a phone, wouldn't hold a charge and it was new.\n",
      "This is not a phone for people who use it for work Barely worked better than not being hooked to it at all.\n",
      "I wanted to give them a chance since I travel for worked and used it in a lot of different places and my signal never got worse or better when using this product.\n",
      "After reading many reviews I realized that the issue of weak cell signals can be fixed, easily and permanently, with a cell phone that can use WIFI to make receive calls text and data.\n",
      "I use my cell as my only phone so I need it to work at all times.\n",
      "Returned the item and had to buy a new cell phone using Verizon towers, which worked and cost a lot less that this booster.\n",
      "If this fit my phone it would've been the best product ever because the quality of this thing is very good.\n",
      "Worked less than a week then would not even hold a charge......save your money buy a new phone.\n",
      "This phone never worked...I couldn't return it because I bought it for someone in another country....this was a pure rip off ppl be aware the phone came with out the owner's manual, and head set.\n",
      "Doesn't work I like the phone when it worked but every time it stay with you out side it would die Wanted a simple phone for my dad to travel with but when I received this phone it had no sound no matter how high the volume settings were, it can only vibrate, and the battery life is beyond unsatisfactory, the moment charge is complete it took about 10-15 min.\n",
      "Go to Best Buy, they honor their warranty with a phone that works equal to what you bought at time of purchase if you have problems.\n",
      "It worked for a month then stopped finally got the phone after waiting 3 weeks...remember this seller is from china...and no the phone will not take a charge...the battery upon closer inspection is cracked...nice..i haven't even been able to use the phone yet...will order new battery...this seller is suspect...the phone looks good but the seller shipped the item with the battery in the phone>>>not to thrilled about this purchase...\n",
      "This is not a reflection of the seller at all, I just think this phone is not a very good product I am going to return phone it will not stay charged for more than an hour, that's the only problem so far but unable to use for extended time to see if there are any other issues.\n",
      "THE PHONE WOULD NOT WORK.\n",
      "Trust me Do not buy from this company, make sure you read the FINE PRINT (wich I never Saw it), I bought a product from them and I try to return it and I got and stupid answer from them, after 3 attempts.\n",
      "After a few days one side shorted out & it was the adapter connection that had frayed even though it was never removed by wire-always carefully handled...i replaced it w a new spare but several weeks of trying to figure out what the sound quality problems were with new headphones and whether it was a ripping/ download setting....finally discovered the distortion & thin sound was this adapter!!\n",
      "So, if any using spigen phone case and wanted to use this adapter for putting aux then this will not work\n"

      "It's good for beginners I recommend this starter Ukulele kit.  I has everything you\n",
      "need to learn the Ukulele. G'daughter received this for Christmas present last year and plays if often. thanx, b My grandson is very happy with his new uke! I am enjoying my ukulele. I had one a long time ago. It came with a good teaching book with a CD and a DVD. The ukulele came with bag, and it also came with a set of strings.  I did purchase a tuner from Amazon, which works swell. I am learning to play already. It is fun to play. It is a good way to learn to play. Good Haven't open this yet. Cannot wait to see my son's face on Christmas Day when he opens it! My 14 yr. old daughter already had a ukelele that I bought on Amazon a few years ago for about the same price ($34.95), but without all the accessories that this one comes with! She's planning to give this one to her best friend for her birthday soon. Learning to play a uke is pretty easy, and it makes it easier to learn to play the guitar later on! My hubby and I decided we wanted to learn to play the uke, so we ordered this set based on decent reviews.  Wonderful.  We learned to play thanks to this kit.  While the instrument itself certainly isn't of high quality, it is more than adequate and has a good sound.  The real jewel in the crown 'tho is the instruction book.  Fab! It is highly informative, easy to follow, and has some good songs in it.  I still use it for reference and do not pick up my uke without that book nearby. This is a great package for beginners. I never played a ukelele before but I learned to play guitar many years ago.  I have no idea on how to tune a ukelele so I downloaded an app called \"Easy Ukelele\" available in Amazon and Google Playstore for free.  That is the only ukelele tuner I can recommend for beginners as it actually listens to your Ukelele and tells you when your device is in tune. I purchase this as gift to my son's 5th birthday that is coming up in 2 weeks so I have not yet preview the DVD and CD that came with it. I did however, checked and played with the ukelele while my son is at school, sleeping or playing outside to make sure that it is properly working when he open the box on his birthday and before the return period runs out.\n",
      "\n",
      "My Review:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The Package: The box comes with the Ukelele, Beginners Manual, DVD, CD, carry pack, and 2 extra set of Ukelele strings. Tuner is not included so I advise that you either buy a tuner or download the \"Easy Ukelele\" app I mentioned above.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The Ukelele:  The Ukelele looks and feels decent. It has a sticker that says made in china. It comes pre-strung but it is out of tune.  I tuned it using the app I downloaded but it would not hold a tune. It is very bad that the sting gets out of tune before you even finish tuning all the other strings.  Basically, the ukelele sounded like an out of tuned toy when you first take it out of the box and even after a few adjustments.  Since the string is nylon, I gave it a chance to settle. I would tune it really sharp and leave it alone for at least 10 minutes or more then pick it up and strum on it and push the string from side to side.  I actually position the tuner pegs horizontally so I can see if it is moving when the string gets more tension. The tuner pegs stays in place so I know that the problem is with the string.  It could be that the string included is a cheap one.  After doing this a few time on day 1, I was able to play my first song I grabbed from the book (Clementine).  But after 1 song, you have to tune it again.  I just repeat what I did for the next 2 days, tuning it sharp and leaving it alone and play songs. Yesterday morning I tuned it sharp before leaving to work and when I came back in the afternoon, I checked the strings and they are still tuned to the same key I left them in the morning. I played with it for at least 10 minutes just trying to learn the music from the book and I was able to play at least 4 songs without any problem.  This morning, I checked the note again and they stay close to the G-C-E-A range. I could see this improving more as the ukelele gets used more. Even if I have to tune it every day  I would not have any problem with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for the reviews complaining about the device being out of tuned, just give the string a try to settle. This are cheap string that they included here and it will take time to settle in. Or you can buy a better quality string that costs around $9.00 for a set.  Another place you can check is the tuner, make sure that it does not get pulled back when the strings tension. If it would not hold its place then just grab a philips screw driver and tighten it a little.  That is an easy fix.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The String: As I mentioned above, it is a cheap string that needs a lot of adjusting until it settles. Even if you buy a  good quality strings, I am sure that it will also need a few adjustment in the beginning. It comes with 2 extra set in case you accidentally snap the one that is already installed. The problem is that the extra set does not have a label so you have to eyeball it.  From some research I found online they said that the Thinnest string will be the A string. The second thinnest is the E string, The thickest is the C string and the second thickest is the G string. The extra string package says \"Gangia Brand\" on it so I assumed that that is the brand of the string.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The Book: I just scanned the book and I could tell that it is written well for beginners. The songs included progress from only needing 2 chords in the beginning and they add more chords on the succeeding lessons. Each song have a chart on which chord you will use.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The Case:  The case will protect your ukelele from dust, water and from getting dirty while you are transporting it but will definitely protect the device from being damage in case of a drop.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The DVD's and CD's: I have not tried the DVD and CD's yet but the DVD's I believe will have the lesson and the CD will have the songs on the books so you can listen to it and have an idea on how to play the songs on the book. I will come back and edit this item once I get the chance to watch the DVD and listen to the CD.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall. This is a great price for the package. Please don't listen to these amateurs talking about how the strings wouldn't keep tune. They don't know anything about stringed instruments or nylon strings. You have to keep tuning it until the strings stretch. Like all instruments, the strings have to stretch, especially with nylons, so be patient. It only took me about half an hour. It clearly states STARTER pack, so obviously its not going to be a high quality ukulele, especially because of the price. These people just do not know how to read. It has a great sound, but the 'lightweight gig bag' definitely is lightweight. If you want real protection, I would recommend getting a hard case or something along the lines. it is a great buy though, considering the price. I highly recommend this product. This is a good starter for children to learn, and easy to follow with the song book and whole family love it. Honestly, it's painful to play hunched over at this point in my life.  The A-frame allows me to sit up comfortably like I'm wearing a strap , but without the added weight on my shoulder.  It's pretty easily adjustable.  I find myself using it on either leg (classical style or traditional) and it works either way pretty well, keeping me from bending.  In the past, I've had one of the cushion-style supports and they just aren't the same.  You can't adjust them well enough to really use them to suit your specific needs, depending on your height, guitar etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the one to get. This has to be one of the best investments I've ever made, barring my case to protect my baby. It folds up and fits in my case just barely, but more importantly it does what it's supposed to do - help maintain proper form. I used a foot stool for awhile but I always ended up getting a little kink in my back that still hasn't gone away completely. The thing just works - I pop it on and my guitar just sits in my lap, ready to play. The black strap on the bottom is rubberized so it doesn't slide around on your leg. I've gotten a lot of people who ask me where they can get one. I can't believe Guitar Center doesn't carry anything like it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a side note, after having it for a few months, some of the black coating on the metal flaked off, but to no detriment functionally. Where have you been all my life? This should be standard for all classical players. (Get the cheaper one though.) No more pain finally! I had a foot stool/stand and after an hour of so of playing/practicing, my leg and back would start hurting even when sitting properly. In addition I could never get the proper neck angle for the straight wrist I wanted. No more with this amazing support! Plus the support folds in when I put away my guitar on its stand. Thank you for making this! Pure and simple awesomeness! I'm thrilled with this system for learning guitar. I've always wanted to learn but felt learning chords was daunting. Now, I can learn the timing of strumming and pick strumming without worrying about the chords so much (yet). I'm moving ahead slowly with this system and have started playing the songs in the course and this success has created within me a desire to continue. We also have one for my left-handed son (7) and his left-handed guitar. He is learning right along side me. We are really enjoying doing this together. The Chord Buddy has made this easy and affordable. Once we complete the course the plan is to move on to more lessons so this isn't the end-all but it is the best way I've seen to get started. I'd recommend this to anyone that wants to start out. Tip: Be sure to get a \"new\" Chord Buddy that no one else has pulled out and replaced the tabs already. Can't believe this little gem. I ordered one for my wife sort of as a joke but after a week she was strumming songs on the guitar without the Chordbuddy. Last Sunday night, five weeks later, we had a picking at our church and she played along with us for two hours.\n",
      "Now a couple of things, l have played guitar professionally for years and I was able to show her some shortcuts and \"tricks\". She has learned to move between most chords quickly and without difficulty. I have her using a capo for songs in the key of C as she has some trouble holding F chord but she will master that.\n",
      "Also, the instruction materials that come with the system are great. She faithfully practiced for at least an hour every night sore fingers and all but after five weeks I can't believe what she has accomplished.\n",
      "I don't believe that just anyone could do what she's done in five weeks because she was driven to play. I have a small recording studio and she plays piano for our recording sessions which helps her as she understands cord progression and structure.\n",
      "But... If you have wanted to learn to strum a guitar using proper chords to play most any songs, don't hesitate to get the Chordbuddy. It is beyond doubt the best way to learn to play a guitar I've ever seen! Waiting to hear the results ok for learning, Did not fit on guitar as well as seen on tv. Still trying to figure it out. A little harder than it seems. Or it was just me. my daughter was strumming along on Christmas morning.  this is definitely able to provide a false sense of actually playing the guitar, but with the lack of patience that younger generations appear to have this is a good item to have. perfect I am just a beginner. Was playing chords within an hour. Very happy with it. Set-up took a little time. After that I was flying. Easy on the fingers. The DVD is very helpful. Makes it fun to learn. Should have bought two. I am a intermediate player. I know these chords. I am getting older and my hands getting slower. So I bought this to use to save a little on my tired hands. I can play many many songs with just these few simple chords and that is why I purchased it and I was hoping my child would see the ease and give it a try, I hope they do. this is a good learning tool for novice players that allow them to play songs in just a few moments, something very few systems do. Many get fustrated tring to play, this item takes away allot of that fustration in learning hand positions and allows them to play a song immediately. Great product for the novice, and the intermediate player and some older players with age may find this simple solution of tired hands easy to compensate for that problem and still play.( one thing I must mention, do not let this be a crutch for learning the correct chords and finger positions. It is so easy it will distract that fact from your learning and make it easy to push one button instead of learning the fingering and you will rely on it to much,Please learn from it and don't rely on it all the time) Still a great product and will indeed help you to learn the finger positions one chord at a time. Hi, loved the chord buddy.  I just got a new guitar for Christmas.  I am also brand new to playing, and this is very helpful.  I'm sure\n",
      "it will be great for people with arthritis that already play and want to continue playing without the pain.  I like the beginner cheat method to help me learn. I never used it yet. But my husband tried it out .He plays in a band with a guitar. And his comment was ,he was amaze on how it let you play. He said you have to learn where the color are with your finger. It was a bit awkward for him because he can play a guitar. But he said it would be great for me to teach me. Thank you I love the Chord Buddy!!! I have learned to play the guitar and have learned to strum so many ways!! I have shown it to my friends and one friend had me order one for her!!  I just can't say enough. If you love music, you will love this!!!  Karen Strader This books proves to be handy to any self-learner. I have been playing guitar for 4 years now, yet this book and the 7002 come with great pieces of advice. The eagle cartoons and illustrations are funny and go straight to the point. I recommend this book to anyone looking to learn guitar or anyone who might want to renforce concepts. Besides, it has an affordable price :) The Ernie Ball series (1 & 2) is great for learning guitar basics.  Now you just need to practice, practice, practice. I have been using QSC K10s for close to a couple of years now. I am a solo performer, playing a variety of styles from acoustic singer-songwriter stuff to loop-driven electro-rock. I typically play bars and have probably used these for nearly 100 gigs at this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "3 K10s along with an&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Allen-Heath-ZED-10FX-Four-Mono-Mic-Lines-with-2-Active-D-I-3-Stereo-Line-Inputs-and-Onboard-Effects/dp/B003T77ZJU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Allen & Heath ZED-10FX Four Mono Mic/Lines with 2 Active D.I., 3 Stereo Line Inputs and Onboard Effects</a>&nbsp;mixer make up my whole system, using two as mains and one as a monitor. My previous system was a powered Mackie box and passive 12\" speakers by Community and Yamaha.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have thus far been thrilled with the significant sound improvement I have experienced. The volume and clarity that these 10\" speakers produce is truly impressive. To give you an idea, I generally play rooms that are one to two thousand square feet in size and rarely turn my mains up much past 50%. At 60-75% levels (with mixer meters peaking around the zero mark) the music will cut through even the rowdiest bar noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing that's great about this 10\" model is the throw. With a super-wide 90 degree dispersion angle, sound fills out the space up close within a few feet, depending on placement (I prefer getting them up as high as possible on stands and using the clever 7.5 degree tilt function). The dispersion angle is also matched between the woofer and tweeter so you're never hearing just one or the other. 90 degrees is ideal for tight performance areas where you want people right in front of you to hear everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trade-off here is that levels decrease quickly as you step back from the speakers. You can hear a significant difference as you get more than twenty or thirty feet away. While that could be seen as a negative especially for public address applications, I find it to be a win-win.  It essentially creates a \"full sound\" zone around the stage for the audience. I personally prefer creating a live music environment where people can hear a loud, full spectrum mix if they like but not have it forced on them wherever they are in the room. If your needs call for a speaker with more reach, the K12s (I've used them) throw a lot further and sound awesome as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of sound quality, I will say that while I think the K10 kicks the competition's a** throughout the EQ, it is especially spectacular in the mids and highs. Just playing an iPod through them, you will hear separated parts of the music in this range that you never did before. As far as your perfomances go, vocals and guitars will sparkle in a way you probably haven't heard out of a small cabinet.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't want to downplay the bass response on these though. It is huge and far more than you would expect out of these little guys. The frequency coverage is absolutely there and can even be boosted if you utilize the DEEP switch. What you will NOT hear in the lower registers however is a ton of attack. They are more suited to adequately express a jazzy upright bass than they are to throw down the punch you want to hear from electronica or hip-hop (unless we're talking smaller spaces, they'll ROCK a house party DJs). Impressive but you'll find no magic here, that's why they make the Ksub.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prospective buyers should also know that the 1 KW amp in these is Class D. That's not equivalent to 1000 watts in Class A for example. It's more than sufficient though and Class D amps are great for their light weight and power efficiency. I plug mine into a surge protector that powers a bunch of other devices simultaneously and have never had an issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Signal routing is wildly flexible with the fantastic panel on the back. You can do whatever you want with these including play a small gig with one speaker alone. Just plug a mic, an instrument, and an iPod directly in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ergonomics are well done too. Knobs and switches are not fancy but easy to operate. There's also super sturdy, comfy handles on the top and on one side. Carrying two at once is easy (32 lbs. each) and saves you a trip back to the car.\n",
      "\n",
      "The build quality is solid. I've always been careful with them but not used cases or bags and the only damage thus far has been cosmetic. The sides will scuff up pretty easily so use the duffels if thats important to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have not observed any malfunction up to this point other than some buzzing from the monitor once when it got rained on. After drying out, it didn't happen again. QSC has also put some serious limiting circuitry into these as well to protect themselves from blowing. I have more than once pushed my monitor too hard and reached this threshold. The signal simply cuts out when the the speaker cone experiences too much travel. Once you readjust the levels, you're back in business with no issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't think of much to gripe about, the whole K series was very well thought out. I would love to incorporate a Ksub at some point as the crossover function is built into the entire line. These speakers aren't cheap at $700 a piece but you'll be paying for quality and design that cannot be found elsewhere. I like this speaker. I bought a pair of K10s because I wanted a stereo image for my piano and the clarity and presence are phenomenal. Un-muddied left hand bass and crisp high notes. I'm hearing subtleties in my keyboard that I haven't heard before. I'm using them on stands behind me in my Irish band to mic an accordion and tin whistle and they both sound great with these speakers running through an 8 channel Yamaha mixer.\n",
      "\n",
      "At 32lbs, they're easy to carry around, especially with the totes, and light to get up on stands. These speakers go really loud, so it's nice that I can set the speaker fader only half way and still get good volume. Really helps prevent feedback from the condenser  mics. Best bang for the buck.  Great bass for a 10\" speaker - perfect for singer/guitar player plus I use it as my monitor for the rock and roll band.  Excellent quality.  Enough inputs to bypass a mixer but I still use a Yamaha to fine-tune the sound.\n",
      "I have two of these plus an EV ZLP powered 12\" speaker as a monitor but if I had the money I'd have 3 of these instead.  Buy with confidence. I bought these offered in a special bundle on Amazon. They are in a class by themselves - really a top product. I have pro speaker gear from JBL, Mackie and Cerwin Vega. They are all good, but for me, these QScs are simply the best for sound quality/clarity, loudness and integrated power (500W per driver = 1000W per cabinet). When you then further consider the portability, functionality and performance, they are fully worth their premium price tag. I was initially sceptical about the high price, having bought them after all my others, and for more money, but I now think they may well have been my best-value purchase of the lot. I certainly use them more than all the others for convenience including outside jobs with potentially suspect weather (I got the matching outdoor speaker covers and so they can play on their stands outdoors in light rain). I remember at an outdoor gig once, the wind blew my projector screen unto my K10 speaker and stand, so that the K10 fell about 7ft to the hard asphalt ground. It suffered a small dent on the front grill (was in the cover), but did not skip a beat and kept right on playing through the incident, and have continued on with no problems ever since\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, a really fine powered pro speaker. You can get many alternatives for much less, but I think this is really outstanding value for money Although it seems pricey, I've got to say that this is the best sounding powered speaker I have ever heard or used. It is awesome for vocals - rich and full, excellent clarity. Awesome for acoustic guitar and violin - very natural sounding. Very good for recorded music. It's not particularly great for bass guitar, but it's OK. Great coverage, it opens up right away, short throw situations this works very well. This thing is LOUD but still very clear. If they weren't so expensive, I'd have bought another one already. I think I need a sub for the bass, though. These are definitely great and light weight to use as monitors for a 4+ piece live band, but did not satisfy my expectations while using it for mains. It is great as mains for a single to a trio act, but not beyond if you want that solid full sound of a 4+ live band. It's basically personal preference, therefore for my use, it's limited to being a good source for monitors. And the quality is superb but don't lay it on its grill when using the carrying bags because the grill dents easily. I can only compare these with the Yamaha DXR (?) series. I own both, being a two keyboard household. I prefer this one, but both sound great. The QSC is extremely well built and goes into low power mode when it should. Very easy to play and sounds great. works and sounds great for what it is! LUV IT, great sound, came still tuned nice accessories, easy to play with cards Perfect for anybody!!!! Price is VERY reasonable. Great sound. Music sheets make it easy to play. I suggest getting the Music Maker carrying case as well to protect the harp and the music sheets. Tuning is tricky. I suggest too getting an electronic tuner!!! EZ-Tuner 8 works great. The harp music relaxes me, and whenever I am feeling stressed, I pause a while and play my harp. Have fun. My 8 year old daughter loves this. It is a great gift for both boys and girls. Not for a professional gig, but it's playable.  But, realize you have to learn how to tool it, even if it were tune prior to shipping.  Any string e x instrument will quickly go out of tun e u until it is broken in.  One of the sheets describes which strings should be turned to which note.  You need any reasonable means to tune it, be it an electronic tuner, a keyboard, or reference tones off the internet.  This is one of those things you have to learn to do for any string instrument.  By the way, when tuning the peg will sometimes get to a position where it will seem that you can't properly get the tool on it.  The tool has the same opening on the other end, only rotated, so you sound use the opposite end of the tool if you when you run into this situation...probably buried in the instructions somewhere.  Happy harping... and look for their song book for addition music templates... No need to learn to read music, if you don't want to. I do strongly believe that every household should have one of these harps. Even if you don't like Celtic music, these little harps are really cool! This is a great product. It is easy and fun to play. I am a musician, so was able to tune it without difficulty, but it was completely out of tun when it arrived, which would be a problem for a some. This is, by the way, our second harp--I bought one about 10 years ago. Since my young daughter likes it, I bought a second one so we can play together. after 1 year, still going strong. Recommend! I have been beating these around for 9 years now and they are just as great as the day I bought them.  Still intact no sign of wear and tear.  Love the fold up design.  Glad to see they are still making these. I will keep it simple folks! I bought them, I tried them, I love 'em! Very versatile so far! I'm no sound expert, but I know what I like! And these Sony's are great! I also plan to try the Beyerdynamics 770Ts with 250 ohms and compare sound quality and comfort! Shipping was fast and my phones were in mint condition upon arrival! Thanks again Amazon! Okay, okay, I caught your attention. I bought this to plug into my Tascam DR-05 compact recorder-- the plan to record my rock and roll band. I LOVE IT. The recordings are unparalleled. Highly recommend this unit. It records the loudest shows, rock concerts, small club gigs, and I record every practice and we play, and it has been to  MANY shows! The Mic appears to be a well designed mic that will go forever (the battery life is great [1AA] too) Great, as well,  its picking up the most sensitive sounds. I also used it with my outdoor drum circle. Listening to the recording, you could close your eyes and you wouldn't know you weren't there in person --- of course the Tascam is pretty high quality, but this is GREAT. Buy it!!!\n",

      "EDIT - November 16 2016 ---- and this thing is STILL making recordings of live rehearsals that are mind-blowing. I put them on Soundcloud and everyone remarks on how amazing they sound. Great mic, can't say enough about it. Really nice mic. I've got many great recordings from it. Battery lasts forever, especially if you remember to turn the mic off when not in use, but even if you don't! I purchased this microphone to use with our canon video camera. We have used it to record several music recitals and band concerts and have been pleased with the audio quality. I'm a professional piano technician and part-time musician. I use this mic (plugged into a Boss Micro BR recorder) for recording band rehearsals and gigs. It has a very nice clear, \"transparent\" sound quality and handles high volume levels with no problem. This product came in a very timely manner, excellent price through Amazon, and resolved a little confusion along way.  The product itself is very durable.  My last one lasted three years, and it was used three times a day, and did receive abuse from my autistic son, and survived. Not as light weight as others but strong and a good choice for my family and life style. I love these headphones, as well as the MDR-V600 headphones.  I believe the oil from your skin over time will cause the coating to slough off of the earphone padding skin.  However, since hygiene is of utmost importance, especially if more than one person is using the headphones, I have purchased some sanitary headphone covers.  This not only keeps the headphones clean, it also makes the headphone ear pads last forever.  Just an idea, but try using sanitary headphone covers on ALL your headphones.  I believe you can buy a bag of 100 on-line for about $18.00.  It's definitely worth protecting these wonderful headphones.  I use them in my home studio, and the frequency response is excellent, and I can hear every note, not to mention the exceptional large drivers (50-mm) that the headphones contain. These work well to extend your boomwhacker set down an octave. love to add these to my class sets of Boomwackers.  The kids prefer the ower sound. These fit my boomwhackers well. The price was what you would expect, about a dollar and a half apiece. They appear to be durable. Don't knock the recorder; it's a serious instrument if you take it seriously and don't blow as hard you can. Just takes a little effort to learn, like most worthwhile activities. Bought this for my daughter's birthday. Without any prior experience playing a recorder, you may get some squeaks on the lower notes. That's common and easy to correct. Usually, you're blowing too hard or you're not covering the wholes tightly. Also, you can make a note sound sharp or flat by blowing too hard or by blowing weakly. It's a musical instrument. You have to LEARN how to play it. Go to YouTube for help.\n",
      "This recorder sounds clear and loud. Hole spacing seems correct. The holes are easy to cover and there is a clear distinction between notes.\n",
      "Thick plastic makes it feel durable, but it's very light weight which makes it easier to play faster (since you aren't using much hand strength and coordination to hold the instrument up).\n",
      "Like any instrument, it will require some practice to get the hang of it and get proficient, but this is pretty easy to play. Meaning, you can get a good, strong sound and play some simple songs on it right away. At the price offered at the time of this writing (approx. $9), it's worth buying 2 (so you can play along with someone else) so long, i like it Hey, iT's a yamaha! Yamaha makes every thing well.. I love this recorder :) good Product. Great recorder ( for the price) . It got me back into playing recorder. What a great deal.  My daughter plays this one when I play the slightly more expensive yamanah one.  This one is fine for anyone to learn on, I'm in my 30's and just started. Good for any body. Fun to play Great price.  Needed for a grade school music class. Quality instrument that sounds and plays as it should.  Rarely has Yamaha let me down with any product. These were bought for my two sons who are using these in school for music.  I had to use them in school and remember using used recorders, and did not want my kids going through the same embarrassment.  Very nice product and quickly delivered. For a cheap recorder they are in tune and sound good.  Give them as gifts to revive music in our culture. I bought this for one of my students. She's very happy practicing every day with it. These are great!! they're durable and they do the job! no complaints here!! The instructions it comes with can be a little confusing but all you have to do is google \"playing a recorder\" and you'll find a plethora of info. Not the most awesome instrument ever but at this price have to give it 5 stars, it has decent sound and seems very durable. Pretty easy to play, and they give you a little sack to put it in. Great 3 piece recorder that sounds great when played right :) I know you have all heard the screeches the kids can make with these! This item delivers exactly as described.  The tone is wonderful and much better than other options which are only a dollar or so less expensive.  The price can't be beat.  We have both the Soprano and the Alto from the 24 series and I don't see how these can be beat except by instruments costing in the hundreds of dollars.  I highly recommend this product, I would buy it again if needed. i bought this for my 5 yr old daughter, although she's just learning but it's a good start.  i recommend I bought this for my daughter so she could practice over the summer.  She loves it!  It's good quality and the pouch that it comes in is perfect.\n",
      "I can't imagine anything better short of making it from real wood. Great quality at a great price -  I make these available to my students at cost so they don't have to share the school recorders (yes i sanitize them daily).  They love all four colors - pink, green, blue, and ivory - and often trade with their friends to make multi-colored recorders to suit their individuality and creativity. Bought as toy for grandson for his music collection. Holds up well to child handling. Also great tone for serious music. This is a real instrument and I brought it to teach my grandson how to play. He thinks it's \"neat\". This recorder is  good balance of quality and price. The color makes it look more like an instrument than a toy. It seems to have less moisture problems than the clear candy colored sopranos.  This instrument is easy to clean with  a mild non bacterial, non hand creme dish liquid or in the dish washer with the 3 parts all standing up on pegs. I have had a Yamaha Recorder for 15 years. I recently bought this for my friend who likes mine. I am a loyal yamaha consumer. Cant go wrong with it. It came fresh new in box. In very great condition. Loved it overall. Surprisingly high quality. I've had this guitar for nearly five years now, and it's been absolutely excellent throughout. As a primarily electric player, I find myself reaching for this guitar much more often than I reach for my much more expensive Seagull entourage rustic steel string acoustic. I have played much more expensive classical guitars, and, though they may feel slightly better, they sound about the same, and offer the same range of tonal possibilities (maybe a true classical guitarist might beg to differ, but for the occasional gipsy kings play along, latin jazz/bossa nova, and Bouree in E minor, it is quite acceptable). It comes rather decently set up out of the box, as I've never had to change a thing, it takes abuse rather well, sounds and looks pretty good, and definitely won't break the bank. It's definitely a guitar that you won't be afraid to take places, and will never regret bringing along if you do. For the beginning guitarist, someone starting out in classical, flamenco, or fingerstyle, or anyone who's looking for a very playable inexpensive instrument to add to their collection, this instrument really fits the bill. I review this guitar based on its features versus price. If course, it is unfair to compare a 140$ guitar with a 1000+$ guitar.\n",
      "I got this one, very old, from a friend who gave it to me. It has very high action, hard to play, etc.. all the bad things some reviews mentioned about here. That's why my friend gave it to me.\n",
      "I went thru the set up myself to lower action at the nut and action at fret#12. Now it plays really smooth, easy on my fingers. This is not something a casual guitar player or newbee knows.\n",
      "Most string instruments, when newly bought, need to go thru a setup to be playable. Sometimes you are lucky that the action is low enough and this can be skipped.\n",
      "The sound is good for this price range. It does not sound as good a a few 5000$ I had chance to play and that's all expected.\n",
      "I even go further to install a preamp/under-saddel transducer to turn it into electric.\n",
      "Plugging into an amp, it sounds amazing. I can play, amplified, on stage with it. I got this guitar 2003 and seven years later it still has an amazing sound. This guitar has a strong neck and keeps its tune for a long time. Many people have played this guitar and just love how it sounds. This guitars quality is as good as any classical guitar, the price is a good deal. You won't regret buying this guitar. I use Augustine classical guitar strings, I also use Pro Arte (Normal Tension EJ45C) classical guitar strings which sound really good (highly recommended). For those who are first time guitar buyers...NEVER put steel strings on a classical guitar because the neck is not strong enough and it will bend or snap. Classical guitar strings are nylon. Keep guitar away from extreme heat. This guitar looks nice and has a gloss finish. The neck is not too big or too small, it's just right. Handling is good and has a white mark indicating the 7th fret where you can easily see it. I recently took this guitar off the wall rack in my home studio where it sat for 2 years and played it and  stayed nearly in tune, it was only a flat from standard E tuning. I always like this guitar better from more expensive because price, quality, and tone. Upon purchasing this guitar, cuz I neeeded for a classical class that I took back then, I changed the strings to D'addario pro arte hard tension and the sound gain a richer tone. Even my instructor who was a hardcore classical player noticed. Im so happy with my Yamaha, So glad that I purchase it instead of a $fifteen hundred dollar Ramirez.. When I was 15 years old I bought this same or similar Yamaha Classical Guitar model. It was one I bought used from a friend's guitar teacher. I loved that guitar. Never did I have a single complaint about it. And I had it with me everywhere I went until I was almost 40 years old.\n",
      "\n",
      "My son was an avid electric guitar player who wanted to give acoustic a try. Since I didn't have time to play my guitar during that time of my life I LENT my guitar to him. When I eventually had more free time and wanted to get back into my music I asked my son to please return my guitar, the one I let him BORROW. It was at that time he informed me that he SOLD it to a buddy when he needed money buy a Fender bass. Kids...\n",
      "\n",
      "So...I bought this one and am very happy to have a Yamaha Classical Guitar back in my possession. The only differences I can see between my old one and this one are the colors and design around the sound hole and the absence of Yamaha on the headstock. To be sure this was the brand of classical guitar I wanted, I tried several different brands and models available on Amazon.com at local guitar stores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every other brand of classical guitar, regardless of the price, did not hold up to the sound of the Yamaha guitars. I'm not saying the other brands did not sound good. What I'm saying is the Yamahas sounded great. Should I ever decide to upgrade to a better classical guitar, I will stay with Yamaha.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could not find a lower price for this model than the Amazon.com price...anywhere. Having the Free Shipping option was a major plus.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is only one reason I needed to call the Yamaha Customer Support Line. I needed to ask where the serial number is located. I couldn't find it to save my life. On the C40, look inside the sound hole to the inside edge of the fretboard.\n",
      "\n",
      "My guitar was wrapped very well for shipping. It came with \"The Yamaha Guitar Quickstart DVD.\" The DVD has some very useful information to help you get started if you have no idea what to do with your guitar once you take it out of the box. A \"Welcome\" sheet with some good basics for beginners was also included.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is so good to have another Yamaha Classsical Guitar back in my life. I love this product's guarantee-- if defective, just walk into a store and get a replacement.  Amateur use, so have less judgment as to its performance characteristics. monster makes the best cable i ever used its so tough compared to other cables. it has a life time warranty i love 30ft is a practical length for live performances and in the studio. I have always been a fan of monster cable quality and design. Personally, it's the only cable I buy. Some might t honk the name is not worth the price. In a lot of cases that's true but not with this stuff the \"100 series\" microphone and instrument cables are excellent quality at reasonable prices. Monster cable has never let me down, I will never go with any other cable because of the monster quality and reliability.  These cables provide the best and nothing less, because they are made well and they are built to last. Especially at this price. Connectors feel SOLID like they can take a bit more abuse than others in this price range. Really Great Product, soildly built, More than happy with perfomance, and I would ecomend this product to everyone who has a need....Its all Good! Despite all the criticisms I have read over the years about Monster cables, I can't say anything bad about this cable.  All\n",
      "sounds recorded through it were crystal clear and had great sound quality. I needed a fairly long mic cable to reach from my drums to our PA board. This is perfect. The cable is high quality, the XLR fittings appear sturdy and I expect they will last a long time. The signal does not sound not degraded. I am pleased and would recommend this cable. They cables are pretty awesome. I have friends (musicians) that love these cables also.\n",
      "\n",
      "I picked up 3 of these (two 50ft for my SM58 Beta A Mics and a shorter 30ft one for my Guitar Rig/Pedalboard) after growing tired of failing cables! Just last Sunday a cheap XLR cable that connects my Mackie Monitor failed in the middle of a gig! I couldn't hear myself on stage...\n",
      "\n",
      "I've had these Monster cables for about a month so far and they seem great... Flexible but sturdy! Our choir bought some house-brand microphone cables from that website that claims to be a friend to musicians.  They barely outlasted the warranty. We proposed plopping down nearly 4 C-notes on a dozen 20-foot Standard 100 mike cables to our church's finance council.  The words \"Lifetime Warranty\" were the clincher.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hum? Forget about it. Cell phone static? Thing o' the past. CB radio interference? Tunes it right out. The secret is twisted pair construction, which eats up an extra inch or so of wire per foot of finished cable. The signal becomes its own electronic shield against noise. Cheaper cables use a side-by-side or linear configuration.  It saves wire and keeps the price down but the cable acts as an antenna and attracts all kinds of electromagnetic junk from the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "The jacket resists twisting and uncoils smoothly. It also rolls up for storage without fighting back like a snake that's had a few espresso shots.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ends are finished with somewhat oversize connectors, providing a generous grip for smooth insertion and removal, but they can be a hindrance for performers who like a grab a mike off the stand and solo. That's not a problem in a church choir, so we expect the cables to last a long time. If you need a cable with a slimmer connector, move up to the Performer 500 or Studio Pro 1000 series.\n",
      "\n",
      "The finishing touch in our sound setup is the Monster Cable S-100 instrument patch cord and an attenuating adapter for hooking our mixer to the sound system. Velvety-quiet signal transfer and audio quality that's good to the last note.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have yet to use the Lifetime Warranty but the peace of mind is, well, as good as a gift from God. Perfect for my Epiphone Sheraton II.  Monster cables are well constructed.  I have several and never had any problems with any of them over the years.  Got this one because I wanted the 90 degree plug. Like most other Monster products, this cable appears to be well made and reliable.  I bought it for my son's guitar.  It is the first instrument cable I bought from Monster, having used some of their audio cables before.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend this cable - it is reasonably priced and as stated above, well made.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also it comes with the typical Monster warranty and some little inserts of various colors so you can add them to the cable end to distinguish the cable from others. I have used monster cables for years, and with good reason. The lifetime warranty is worth the price alone. Simple fact: cables break, but getting to replace them at no cost is where it's at. Monster makes the best cables and a lifetime warranty doesnt hurt either. This isn't their top of the line series but it works great with my bass guitar rig and has for some time. You cant go wrong with Monster Cables. So good that I bought another one.  Love the heavy cord and gold connectors.  Bass sounds great.  I just learned last night how to coil them up.  I guess I should read instructions more carefully.  But no harm done, still works great! Monster makes a wide array of cables, including some that are very high end. I initially purchased a pair of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Monster-Rock-Instrument-Cable-21-Feet-Angled-to-Straight-1-4-Inch-plug/dp/B0002E38B2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Monster Rock Instrument Cable - 21 Feet - Angled to Straight 1/4-Inch plug</a>&nbsp;to use with my keyboards, but when it came time to purchase cables for my bass and guitar I thought I'd pinch a few pennies.  I am so glad I did.\n",
      "\n",
      "I compared this cable model to the more expensive models I previously purchased and, aside from looks, could not detect any difference in sound. I Swapped back and forth between my guitars and keyboards, ensuring that each model was used on each instrument - still no difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "What the more expensive model has going for it is looks. I am not sure it (the higher priced model) is even more sturdy because the molded stress relief ends on this model seem to make it more reliable than its pricier sibling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line: carefully compare both cables using your own instrument and amp - if possible - before making a purchase decision. You may find, as I did, that higher price does not necessarily equal higher value, even from the same manufacturer. Does exactly what I bought it for, works Great, very happy Works just like it should! No problems. good product, good seller Ive used this pedal with our theatre keyboard and finally broke down to get my own! Very durable. Nice, solid pedal. Built to last. Works as advertised. Nice action; comfortable; stable. Great price and fast shipping. What else can you say, FC7's are the best bang for your buck. Works great. was a package deal with Piano and stand, thanks again, daughter loves it Solid build, I use it to control midi functions on my laptop from my bluetooth floor pad. Works right out of the packaging. No complaints. Excellent quality build for an inexpensive pedal.  Doesn't have the resistance feel of the more expensive Yamaha pedals, but perfect for casual sustain. Yamaha's equipment is always first-rate.  I've used other expression pedal, but nothing feels like the quality of the Yamaha.  You pay more, but you get it all back in being able to use the equipment for many years before replacing. Good proctor from a good seller! Perfect. For what you pay, this is a great pedal. (Got a discount with Prime)\n",
      "I was expecting to receive a dinky pedal about the size of my hand. This is a sturdy large pedal, even wider than my guitar wah pedal. I bought this for use with my Yamaha Reface.  This is a great buy for amazon Primer's. Love the feel. Perfect. Highly recommend. they are perfect! Works great and came in one day! Good Product Works well with my Yamaha keyboard; like the heavy weight & feel. Works great with Yamaha StagePas systems for controlling effects on and off! good for voluming and expressing, has a nice amount of travel between totally off and full volume I love these flat FC5 sustain pedals.  They are much more durable the standard pedals.  Although I still have an original Yamaha pedal that I purchased back in 2002 and it still works perfectly till this day, I'm a little more partial to this one now.  I've been using this pedal for 2 years now and I haven't had ANY problems with it.  I bought this one to keep in my laptop gig bag, in case of a faulty pedal when I do gigs out. Love it Perfect accessory to YPG-235, though works with numerous Yamaha keyboards. Follow instructions for proper setup. Good choice. Great pedal for the price. Great quality Perfect. good product Tried an off-brand, Cherub. hated it--cable broke where it goes into the housing, and it felt light and cheap. Bought this one by Yamaha. Love it. Works as it should. I have a Yamaha keyboard. REAL GOOD This pedal totally surprised me with its ability to outperform the expression of a Hammond B3 that I'm incorporating into my musical setup. Very impressed! Very good quality and built. Affordable and reliable for heavy users. Excellent! ! Good deal! ! My girlfriend used to play piano, but we don't have room for one in our apartment, so I bought her the Yamaha P115 88-key Digital Piano and FC4A Piano Sustain Foot Pedal. Set them both up in our bedroom and the result is amazing. The resistance on the keys is great, it feels like a real piano, and it's small enough to fit next to our bed in our fairly small bedroom with no issues. Audio quality out of the built-in speakers is pretty good, but of course we could always hook it up to a better sound output if we wanted. It was a little pricy, but it's worth it if you need a piano in a small space. Works great on my Roland keyboard. I recommend it. This works great!  So much better than the cheap plastic pedal that comes with the Yamaha 650 piano we bought.  Other people have commented that the pedal is stiff and too high off the floor for their feet.  I think it's just fine.  Couldn't be happier with this purchase. Nice for the price These pedals work very well for my Yamaha drum machine....and they last for years if taken care of.....:~) Worked perfectly. I hope it will last longer than all the other non-Yamaha pedals that imploded through the year. works. feels solid Excellent, just as expected. Worked perfectly. Getting another one for my 6 Works well with my Yamaha p115. I can get subtle variations on the dampening that I could not get with some of the cheaper pedals on the market. Have 2 of them now, working flawlessly. Much cheaper than most competitors, too. Pretty good pedal. Performs how you would expect it to from the looks. Has decent resistance like a real pedal too. works great Great pedal Having tried several different volume pedals, I have to say that hands down, this one is my favorite;\n",
      "\n",
      "The action is very smooth; looking inside (when the pedal is up), it appears to be simply and well constructed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my opinion, the best things about this pedal are that it's heavy and substantial, and that the size of the pedal surface itself is big enough that it's possible to play with precise control. I've tried Korg and Roland products that have bad action, or felt like they could be kicked around on the floor like a tin can. This is not that pedal. This Yamaha Sustain pedal FC4A is very durable. Ok So I have had this awesome sustain pedal on my Yamaha keyboards since Christmas and I have put this pedal through the gambit of abuse while playing in my home studio and out on the road and it is one tough unit. very rugged metal casing that has a rubber cover over the top part of the pedal that moves for your sustain. the cord that comes with it is the perfect length to route the pedal to wherever you need it located. Like I said I have borderline abused this unit as any working musician normally does with their gear and this thing is built like a little tank and has served me very very well, and I would definitely recommend this unit to anyone who needs a sustain pedal for any type of keyboard. This particular unit is actually pretty nifty and small compared to a lot of the other units on the market which are bulky and cumbersome and take up a lot of room when packing up especially when you have limited space in your flight case, but this guys fit right in with my keyboard flight case in my extra storage compartment Works perfect with my old yamaha keyboard at school. Solid and quality product. What a difference from the silly little foot switch that comes with the piano. works good Just started to learn through independent study and online videos. This pedal makes me sound so much better than I am. It's a lot bigger than the picture; that's a good thing. It looks professional. I'm keeping it when I upgrade to the motif series of keyboards. Works perfectly with my keyboard. Good weight and feel. Sturdy. Nice item, good value, Nice and smooth press, no clicking or noise when pressed.  Does exactly what it is supposed to do and appears to be built well.  Not cheaply made, should be a long lasting pedal. It's great. Heavy duty! Good source I bought two of these for a midi controler that I use for looping audio samples, and have set these to record and play the samples. They certainly have a hefty construction, and feel like you could back over them with a truck and nothing would happen to them. They are only switches, so there's not much to them, but the one piece of information that I feel I must pass on is that they don't have much travel, so they would not be a great option as pedals for a keyboard (they would work, but not well). Gigging musician here.  I don't often get too excited about gear, but I gotta say these are excellent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heavy-duty build quality.  totally stage-ready.  Heavy weight and good padding on the bottom make this very stable for live performance. Mine have held up fine through numerous shows with no issues whatsoever.  A really nice feature is that they have a built-in physical connecting plate on the bottom that lets you join these physically together in gangs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some people might not like the heavy weight, but I love the heft.  No accidental kicking it around with stage antics, and built like a tank. One of the best out there.  Long throw, and have had several.  Very sturdy Great pedal, I've used this for keyboards, electronic drum pads, and midi boards. Solid construction, compact, I expect to have this pedal forever. Perfect heavy duty is an understatement, works great and very good quality, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, you will only have to buy one in your lifetime and oh yea! the best price in the market, could not find a used one anywhere. it is very good Yamaha quality!!!! have had it 4 like 3 years and still kicking Works perfectly after setting up the Yamaha DJX EVERYTHING IS OK. perfect  should have bought it years ago Just a basic pedal, I use it with my Alesis drum machine, works great, never fails. Very rugged pedal, very well made and heavy. I took it apart and swapped the tip and ring wires on the potentiometer so I could use it with a Roland RG-33 guitar synthesizer. Works like a champ. Highly recommended; both the pedal and the seller. Would definitely buy again. Made of metal, rubber-coated on top and bottom, and tough, this pedal functions perfectly with Yamaha PSR-e303 keyboard.  (As others have stated, plug in pedal, THEN turn on keyboard so polarity is correctly set on boot-up.)  I expect this pedal will outlive the keyboard it was purchased for, as it is surprisingly rugged for this price point. Delivered on time and as described. Works great and perfect for  my Yamaha YPT-320 which I bought used but just needed something with a simple plug in that enhances the sound. Love the pricing on Amazon and it was delivered ahead of schedule so what's not to like?  Would recommend highly. Excellent I use two of these to trigger my Alesis SR16 for live performance.  Works great!  Very solid/durable/etc. Excellent Product, thank you! A+ A+ Does what I needed it to do. TOP,,AMAZON SELLER,,10/10,,BIG,,THANKS,,() This is the best expression pedal you can buy.  I had owned one previously, loved it, and unfortunately sold it because I wasn't using it any longer.  Sure enough, I needed one again, and borrowed a few other make/models from friends over the past few months.  None of the others felt solid, and they lacked quality.  One of them, another name brand, didn't even work consistently.  So, I found myself buying the pedal I knew would work and be of high quality.  The Yamaha FC7 is road-worthy, has a great feel, consistency in how it tracks, and will last you for a VERY long time. As advertised and speedy service. nicely weighted & feels great to control. Still the best expression pedal out there! Have several of them and they contain a small plate at the bottom to link them together. Has to be required to use on some CV value devices. Excellent product 100% recommended seller Been using this particular model Yamaha volume pedal since the 1980s. This is the same pedal that was included when a Yamaha keyboard (like a DX7 or KX88) was purchased. These days you don't get accessories for \"free\" when a keyboard is purchased ... but the FC7 is fairly priced and solidly built - so well worth it. I just recently replaced one that I had been heavily using since the mid-1980s ... so they last. The pedal feels good under your foot and it is smooth. If you use more than one, they can be conveniently attached together. The FC7 is one of those rare musical products that hasn't been cheapened over time. I've used it with countless brands of electronic keyboards over the years - so it works with any keyboard that has a pedal input. Superb quality as expected, if you're familiar with this brand then you know what it's all about, couldn't ask for more.\n",

The packing was excellent, lightning fast, and the seller kept me informed. Highly recommended Using this on 73 Key Controller emulating a Hammond and able to get all the expression out of the software which previously was not possible I bought this to use with my Tyros 4 and it worked just great.  I replaced the Tyros 4 with a Tyros 5 and the pedal works great with the Tyros 5.  It is an excellent made product that should last a lifetime. So far, this footswitch is working very reliably and is solidly built. It's probably helpful to place some velcro (hook side) to keep it in place on carpeting. I've been using this pedal for about 6 months now with my Yamaha ES6 and it's been great not having to move my hand away from the keys to adjust the volume while playing.\n",

      "In one of the old reviews somebody mentioned that it's hard on the foot when you want to access the entire range. I've found a way around it. I rotated the pedal 180 deg, so that when I press with my toes - it gets more quiet, and when I press with the heel - more loud. This way I avoid this awkward foot position when it's fully muted. It only took about 10min to switch my brain and use it in reverse. And I'm not changing back - it works and it's very comfy. It works great with my Korg Krome-88 Synth. Just have to hook it up to the foot pedal jack & tweak the global settings in the keyboard. PERFECT I got everything I expected out of my order for a good price and the product shipped fast. This pedal works excellent with my old Yamaha electric keyboard! I use this while gigging with my MOX6.  Sturdy, built well, and works just like you'd expect.  Gives me the full volume range with good micro-adjustment. I love it, I used this for my Yamaha ypt-230 and it works great, I would recommend it to anyone Pedal is made real good Not like some of the other  junk light weight Pedals I sent back., Con just a little But not a problem..  Love it. Would buy again, This is a well made high quality pedal so have no doubts on the quality of construction. Yamaha is VERY good.\n",

      "The only thing is that if you're using this with a Digitech processor, it won't work normally.\n",
      "\n",
      "You need a \"continuous control\" pedal for Digitech devices.\n",

      "Good luck! Controls volume by default and works well.  We purchased to set it up in the keyboard settings to change rotary speaker speed on organ setting.  Works well but keyboard settings tricky... but this is the keyboard's fault and not the pedal. works as adversited.  use it in a live stage situation, price was right, bought one for the other keyboard player in the band too. It works well. No polarity switch - would not work with Casio. Keep swinging and playing music  Fats Waller is the best! Got this for my Yamaha EX5 in addition to the FC3 and FC7. I needed the whole set to setup different parameters and control to each. works great! Got this guy and it works perfectly with my Yamaha EX5. Very sturdy in its construction. Great control/motion over the volume unlike other controllers that have a smaller range. I was glad to have read other reviews that suggested we get this pedal right away for a kid who is used to having one on his piano. He uses it just fine. Really it would have been problematic not to have it! I bought this to use in my home studio to control my midi keyboard. It does just what I wanted it to do. Unlike other expression pedals available, Yamaha chose the \"Keep It Simple Stupid\" path.\n",
      "I'm glad they did, because this pedal is very sturdy and does it's job exceptionally well, without any fluff to inflate the price.  It's low cost, it's quality construction, and it does exactly what it says it does.\n",

      "I didn't want to spend $150 on just an expession pedal (such as the roland), but I was wary of spending $50 on the moog or line 6, whose reviews are not exactly raving about their longevity.  I'm glad I found the FC7, it's a quality product at a very reasonable price.\n",

      "* There is no switch to change polarity, so check compatibility with your device. I actually purchased this to act as a foot pedal for a Yamaha Y-DD40. Helped me see just how bad my instrument skills were, however I highly recommend this product. I haven't tried any other foot pedal though. I will mention that it doesn't seem to have a sensitivity to it, just a single button press type. Got this thing because of the great reviews.\n",

      "Rock on! Built like a tank and does all it's suppose to do. Heavy construction which means it will last for years. I love my Yamaha products because there built with quality. I can understand why folks who are most familiar or most comfortable with a pedal that re-creates the feel of what can be found on a real piano might not be thrilled with this.  But I just needed something to be able to get a sustain effect out of an old Yamaha DX21 keyboard.  This product did the job and works great. Fender cords look great and work just as well. By adding the word California to the description I'm sure to sound like the Beach Boys... wanted it just on looks alone...It is a nice looking cord... I know it will perform...as for Sam Ash ...this cord was packed in a mailer inside another box with my Roc n Soc... his shipping team do great work..never any complaints from me... I love Sam Ash.. thanks Amazon Can't find any complaints at all..  Works and sounds as good as cables quite a bit more expensive...\n",

      "Great for that vintage strat sound... OK, I will say it, these cables just look cool in your rig. But beneath the flash you get a quality Fender product that is dependable and sturdy enough to take the punishment of life on the road. I use these between my guitar and effects and pedals to amp on send and return effects, no doubt of which cables are mine. Highly recommend. I've been using these cables for more than 4 months and they are holding up pretty well.  For years I used seemingly indestructable guitar cables that were made for me by an electrician friend.  When they finally gave out, I got in the habit of using the no-name cables that are always on display near the register at Guitar Center- really more of an impulse buy than something I put any thought into.  After the third or fourth Guitar Center cable failed from light use I decided to try these cables.  Not only are they cheaper but they seem to be holding up better.  I am not terribly hard on my gear but my cables tend to get twisted as I move around and the cheaper ones  eventually fail mid-cable.  I don't mind spending a few extra dollars if the cable is a little more durable.  This cable is actually cheaper- $12 or so shipped- and it's holding up pretty well.  These are actually very reasonably priced for 18' cables.  There is some kind of limited life warantee on this product but I haven't needed it.  Five stars for a nicely made 18 foot guitar cable that costs $12 shipped!\n",
      "\n",
      "Incidentally- these cables are shielded and are meant to connect your instrument to your amp's input.  Do not use these to connect an amplifier to a speaker cab.  You want to use unshielded cables for that purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit-  More than 6 months has passed and this cable is functioning without any issues.  The price on these things has gone up significantly and although the cable is highly recommended, there are probably better values from Hosa, Monster or Planet Waves- Once again Fender doesn't disappoint.  These cables are the best, they improve the sound of my guitar tremendously.  It also eliminates some buzz I get when I hook up extra pedals.  Great cables, can't do wrong with a Fender. its a cable.  Its red. It works. looks great with a red guitar.  even works fine for drum triggers.  Nuff said. Exactly as advertised. Excellent.  I have had great luck with all the Hosa cable I've purchased. I've been using these cables on my recording interface for my DAW and for synchronizing some of my synthesizers.  I've never had any issues with the cables, and I'm certain they'll be reliable in the long run. Works and haven't had any problems with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "hard to mess up a midi cable though lol Great for recording E-drums into DAW. Good accessory The plugs have a solid feel; they aren't going to break off in the jack or anything. The cable does what I need it to do, so I'm happy with it. They're MIDI cables. No errors and well made...what else could you want? OK Perfect for the job This cable works like it should, is built with high quality components, and is priced very aggressively to boot. Can't top that combo. I bought these because I really had too long of mike cords for my solo live show. And these are really nice cords if you have a home portastudio recording studio like myself. Who needs all the spaghetti to trip on all over the place? I bought two because I use a Digitech Live 2 Harmony processor and two XLR mike cords are required to make it operational. Good price here too. Hard to find just 10' mike cords. Usually longer ones are only obtainable. Not much to say ... great mic cable, decent thickness/gauge, haven't noticed any noise at all, it works. Never had any problem with Hosa stuff, which is why I chose this cable over others available in a 3' length. So, there you go! Works great!!! Works as expected Just standard MIDI cables.  Work as expected. excellent product great but i should have bought longer ones Cool does the job!,no problems as described got it quickly.  Cable works well Great product at a great price! I'd order again in a heartbeat! I use this for live audio. I run it from my microphone to a vocal effects pedal so I needed a shorter length. I prefer the old-style silver switchcraft/Cannon style ends for their vintage look with my Shure 55H microphone. For recording, I'd go with a higher quality cable but this has been great in a live setting. Works as expected Arrived as advertised and on time. thanks! it's wonderful Works perfectly, no complaints If you need a midi cable, this is the way to go works great cheap, but surprisingly good cable Get's the job done. Its a midi cable Works great. Simply needed a microphone cable to to go from the back of my synthesizer to the telescoping mini boom that was attached to the 2nd tier of my keyboard stand. 3 feet is the perfect length to accomplish this. Works as its supposed to very good good These are just what I needed to make connections. At a stage now where I prefer the more durable midi connection verses the usb connection. Excellent! Can't go wrong with Hosa cables.  They hold up well.  Cheap enough to have extras too. No issues with this purchase or seller. Stands up to stage use for years on end. I've owned and lost a few of these. Works fine with Yamaha keyboard and digital drums great cables at a great price! I am using this Hosa XLR cable on a mic preamp to sound mixer setup.  This distance needs to be kept short and this cable worked out just fine.  The price was most fair and the shipping was very fast, in my case.  Terminal ends seem real solid and the cable itself is of good quality. Great Midi Cable Excellent!!! Works great - has the extra voltage pin required for Voodoo Labs Ground Control Pro workes prefectly, great price! Great Cable! awesome Cables work fine, very flexible.. Great cable. I was worried about how cheap it was. But the quality is that of a $50 midi cable. It's a little less then 1/2\" thick and the midi pins are very sturdy. I had a cheap on before and plugged it in crooked by accident and bent the pins. Should have bought this one in the first place. Works great with my M-Audio midi keyboard. worked perfectly Works as advertised, specifically for a midi keyboard in my application and price was competitive. Does the job! It's a mic cable by Hosa, what else can I say? Hosa has been around for a long time. cable seems well made,\n",
      "we'll se about durability. excellent quality and service This item is as advertised.  Arrived quick.  Was packaged well.  Would recommend product and store front too.  Wanted Rean connectors (Long story), but they do the same job. Can't say much, it's a cable...but cheap and works well. I got this to connect a few audio processing effects to my audio interface.  The cable is worth buying. happy with the whole transaction, will buy more It is an XLR microphone cable. Works as intended, very happy with the purchase to go with my MXL 770 Condenser mic. They are well built and will last.  Miidi cables don't have to be fancy.  Get the length that best reduces your cable clutter. They are good midi cables.  Well built and they last.  You don't need fancy cables for midi Quality as advertised! Not much to say about a 5-foot MIDI cable except that I've always been a fan of Hosa's stuff - it's fairly priced, works for years, and won't leave you wanting for something more expensive.  Fits perfectly into the 5-pin DIN jack on my Korg Volca Bass. excellent. Recommended. A great cable for the short distances. Not much to go wrong here.  But works fine. THis cable was tust length I needed to fit in portable mixer box. I need a short cord to hook up the computer to mixer and this 1 was just what I needed. As advertised! It works. It's cheap and it works. Worked great for my needs! Does the job of connecting my lighting controller to my Traktor Kontrol S4 so that i can use them together with my PC in my sets. It works works well with SDP-6 and Beatbuddy Not a lot to tell, it is a MIDI cable. But it is constructed well with metal ends, and was reasonably priced. I would buy it again. Awesome!  High quality .  I would recommend this to anybody.  Why pay more in a store when you can get it delivered to your door and for cheaper. Its a cord and has done its job , ive had no complaints so why not give it 5 stars Cable is thick, heavy, doesn't kink, and has a quality feel. Strain resistance seems like it should hold up well under medium duty use.  The ends look like they open easily, so it can be made into a shorter cable should it ever fail. In my experience, most Hosa gear seems to be higher quality than the price would indicate. I have never had a problem with Hosa cables. I use them for everything in my home studio. Well made and I've never had one fail. High Quality cable.  The metal connectors seem more durable than others at this price range and fit snugly to the devices I use.  I have mine connected to my M-Audio Keystation Pro 88 and Focusrite Scarlett 18i8.  No signal errors are showing up. No problems and everything as advertised. Does what it does. Go MIDI Just what I needed I have a much longer cable but it's far too long for my current needs. I bought this cable as a shorter replacement. My only worry is the diameter of the cable is much smaller than my other cable. Leads me to wonder about its longevity. So far there isn't any issues though, and I take good care of all of my equipment Works correctly It's a midi cable and it works excellent Good price. Works great. Awesome product! Still rockin' 2 years after purchase and working perfectly. Highly recommended! Works perfectly after a year! Awesome deal. I bought these to go from my board to the amp. We use them for a mobile church so they take a beating. They are still going strong. I like Hosa and Rapco cables.  Never have any complaints on the quality and reliability.  Will definitely purchase more as needed. Perfect short XLR cable.\n",

      "Jerry Good quality cable that should be be able to stand up to punishment on the floor. Using to connect microphone to analog mixer and it functions very well. Perfect for what it is! ok Strong cable, suits my needs. No complaints as of today. It does the job. Proper length, quality is good. Great MIDI cable, reliable. The price is great and the cable allows you some freedom in positioning your equipment. Worked as expected. My RC300 sent tempo info to my SR16 right away As described. I've used a lot of cables and I always come back to HOSA, they are indeed some of the best audio cables in their price range on the market. This was exactly what I was after. I have a voice touch and needed a small cord to connect the mic to the voice touch and this was perfect. Before I used a 20 foot cord to go about 12 inches. I highly recommend this for those who keep the mic on a stand and have a voice touch or other stand connected device for vocals. Hosa makes some of the best good quality, low price audio cables in the business.  I have probably bought over 20 Hosa cables for various applications in my Internet radio business.  Each one has worked flawlessly and been the best value.  I look for Hosa when I look for audio cables. Needed a shorter cable. Couldn't find one locally but found one here on Amazon. Works great. Great product It does what is expected of it.  The cord is nice and flexible. good product works great. Does the trick for my home studio. :) Basic Midi cable. I've had it for a month or two now and it's still working just fine. Sturdy construction no complaints what so ever. Fast shipping item as described. Does what it's supposed to! worked well A good affordable replacement. Working well so far. Works exactly like it's supposed to, not much else to say! I've been more than happy with this cable. I have a spare bedroom converted into a home office and have been working on getting my keyboards and synths more integrated with my computer - my goal is to have a space where, when I have a musical idea, I can quickly get it put together and recorded. I use this 25-foot cable to run from my audio interface over to my music station where it connects to the first device in my MIDI chain. So far it has functioned flawlessly! Thank you!!! Timely and I got exactly what I wanted. Not the best on the market, and not the worst. Hosa is a go-to brand for decent quality at a fair price. Can't go wrong. Work well and as it should. Thanks Solid quality! works great Great experience! Use it every week at gigs.  Solid, no problems with the solder joints.  A good quality cable at a very good price. This is the perfect price, size, and build for someone in need of a quick mic cable.  Length is perfect for most recording setups where a mic would be hooked up to a recorder or preamp.\n",

      "No problems at all with this cable, very high quality! Nice solid cables, with excellent support at the ends.  Should last a lifetime of usage no problem and just what I needed to connect my tube preamp. I've bought a bunch of Hosa cable and it has been nice in terms of quality and price. I needed a short XLR cable for a desktop mic setup and found this one.\n",
      "There isn't too much to say other than it works, is durable, and fits the bill nicely. It is actually quite hard to find premade cables this short and there aren't a lot of options. Luckily this one is also durable and cheap. Wouldn't hesitate to buy another if I needed it. Good enough, they're ridiculously cheap, and they do exactly what they're supposed to do. Couldn't find better at this price point. Connects midi equipment. Works as intended. Just what I needed. Plug and play. No need for any setup. Just remember MIDI OUT goes to MIDI IN. And MIDI IN goes to MIDI IN and every thing just works! These are really long, and they work.  What else is there to say? Great price and simple to use just plug and play for use with Xbox 360 Rock Band 3 Midi PRO-Adapter Better than average quality for this price range. Great functioning cable; perfect length needed for my application. It's fair to say Hosa makes two types of cables for both audio and midi. The really, really cheap, thin, flimsy colored cables, or the Pro cables. Spend the extra few dollars and go the Pro route. It's still cheaper than the competition and you are getting a very comparable cable. The Hosa Premium midi cables have very thick, solid midi connectors that fit nicely into you midi ports and the cable will not easily come out inadvertantly. The rubber-like shielding around the cable itself makes it feel well protected and it won't kink. I use them in the studio but they would work well on stage. I believe the same to be true for their Pro audio cables. No problems here It looks really nice. It's one of the best MIDI cable I have ever seem. You need a 10 foot midi cable? Well, this one is just that. It works well, had no bent pins, and does all the things a midi cable should do. Would buy again. The metal connectors have a quality look. They are also pretty flexible. Now that I see how nice these are I won't bother with anything cheaper. Get them, you'll be happy. The metal connectors have a quality look. They are also pretty flexible. Now that I see how nice these are I won't bother with anything cheaper. Get them, you'll be happy. Good quality for the money. Just what I needed. The quality of Hosa cables is really great for me, I'm a fan because they seem to be well made, sturdy, functional, and I trust they will last for a good while. Perfect size for connecting multi-vocal effects units.  Well made connectors, quickly shipped and durable.  Purchased several of this size to cut down on excess cable line between units for recording purposes.  Highly recommended. I use 2 of these for connecting a rack unit to a Presonus Firepod and they work great.  Sound quality is clear and I hear no extra noise or hiss.  I would buy these again in an instant if needed. No need for a long review but it works. I'm using this for my Audio Technical AT2020 and I'm happy with it. Midi cable. Works as advertised. Item as described Great price good selection. Fast delivery as always. This is a great cable...a little smaller in diam. than I expected but the metal ends are a big plus, and the overall length in this price range was fantastic!  Will be back! Much nicer than the cheap plastic ended midi cables. Looks and feels better, but also locks into place a bit better. HOSA Cables are as much a part of my music as the sounds themselves. I've used these cables for years and they've always performed 100%. This particular cable is your basic MIDI to MIDI cable which I use to connect my synth to my audio interface and it works like a charm! In order to get the drums and all the keyboards hooked to the DAW midi interface and not have them all crowded in one spot, I use the 25 ft cables to give me some breathing room. Now all I need is a\n",

      "Only works if you also have the 25 ft stereo headphone cable too ! Worked perfectly between an external microphone and camcorder. No noise. I was having problems with noise in a recording system. Replaced a 15 ft generic cable with this and the noise is gone. Maybe just going with a shorter cable was all it took, but this cable works great. Good length - I can stretch it anywhere in my home studio.\n",
      "Great quality - The metal tips from Hosa are sturdy and easy to take apart if repairs are needed. Hosa produces my favorite MIDI cables. These metal tipped cables are very durable, and if need be, they are easy to take apart and repair. Recommended purchase for your MIDI setup I've been using this cable for a few months with no issues. Solid construction for an economy cable. Doesn't have the fancy name, but suits the purpose. Get one!! Great cable and works flawless on a number of keyboards. EVERYTHING IS OK. Great cables, I bought a couple for my band so we can perform and these cables are perfect fit. Great length for flexibility and they work great with my equipment. fine piece of gear Good cable, great price! Works great. Great product, performed as advertised. Great product, performed as advertised. Works well! And a good price.... I use it to plug my Casio CZ101 into massive and it works great It worked perfectly for my church, in order to eliminate hum/white noise in the audio from the cable that connects the mixer output to camcoder's audio input, while using it in conjunction with a DI box.  The XLR is connected to the DI Box's output while the 3.5mm is connected to the camcorder.  The mono audio is connected to both left and right channel, so I don't need to do any post-editing.  I also wanted to get the right-angle (L-shaped) plug to reduce stress on the audio port. Worked well to connect my microphone to my camera allowing me to film and record audio and video for interviews. Works great Great price and does the job! Excellent product, very happy with it It works and that is why I purchased it Cheap priced midi cable. Works! Does what it's intended to do, and does it well. Will buy again if I ever need another MIDI cable. This replaces a very old adapter I had been using.  It lets me mic my guitar cab with a standard mic and XLR cable and record directly to my computer's sound card.  Handy to have and something I use a lot. good Just right Used it last night to connect to my DSLR camera and it worked very well! connected I love it.....hook it up to any headphone jack and your good to go Mates my drum machine to my keyboard rig. Works great! excellent product. exactly as advertised and arrived very promptly Perfect for desk top use with my lap top computer. An extension could be added on but I haven't tried that much yet as It just arrived. So far, the signal works without any noticeable degradation or static problems you get with poor connections. I'm happy with it. really good+ just needed an in and out midi cable for my m-audio axiom and m-audio m-track plus and these work well.  What can i say, they're just good cables and good length at 10ft. Great cable for the job. Product exceeded expectation and was delivered as promised! Works perfectly for what I wanted to do -- hook up a pro audio (XLR) mic to the stereo mic input on my computer. Takes the mono signal from the mic and puts it on both L&R channels. Saved me trying to jury rig the setup using XLR to 1/4\" plus adapter plugs. No complaints, works as should & very useful, also a great price.

Outstanding quality, solid, no lag cable.  Reasonable price too.  Love MIDI cable on the tough response over USB cable since MIDI cable does not have the lag that I always hate on USB cable.

I don't want to have to review this because it was something my wife purchased for someone else and I've never seen it...but Amazon is making me do it. It is Vary - Good!  I LOVE IT. This is a nicely made cable, BUT NOTE THIS - if you're looking to hook up a microphone to your computer - be aware that many microphones using this type of plug require \"phantom power\" to operate - this is to say that just plugging it into your computer using the 3.5mm plug will not work for microphones requiring this type of power. Internet search for \"microphone phantom power\" for more information. Nice! Perfect! I need a shorter cable and this fit the bill perfectly. It arrived just when it was expected. Good results. I used these to connect several MIDI modules to my Allen Theater organ.  The perfect length, and decent quality.  They worked fine.  Good pricing too. I'm using this cable as a extension to the foot pedal cable of a Carvin V-3 guitar amp. The cable is well made. The ends snap into place well. And for my application the signal path is silent. When I was searching for MIDI cables for my ART X-15 foot controller, I came across these Hosa ones, and they were $2 dollars each! As they are now $6, I realize I would still be happy with that price as well, as they are high quality plastic and metal connectors, and work flawlessly. You must realize that they are only 5 feet, as I overestimated it and now wish they were longer. For any connection from racked sound modules, this will be perfect. Excellent Great for my handycam. Fast shipping.  Excellent cable.  I have a mogami and can't justify the price.  This one works as well and sound as good. works fine. too early to tell about longevity. Good cable, seems to be well constructed, it's just what I was looking for No complaints. Works as described. Serves us well! If you are looking for a great product that works well, for the right price, this is the one for you.  A great buy! Just trying to find a midi to midi was a task, and you have to make sure the pin config is correct.  This one is a good product and works just fine Works fine just as I expected is okay quality Hosa brand is always good so this meets my expectations as I thought it would. Bought these to extend my Casio Midi Keyboard to play on Xbox 360 Rock Band 3 (vs using the small RB3 Pro Keyboard).  Used with the XBOX360 Midi adapter.  Excellent Quality Hosa, always the company to go to for those speciality cable needs Works fine.  Serves a purpose, solves a problem. Very well packaged and performs as described. Fast delivery. Nice cable for video camera shotgun mic. This cable will send the same mono signal to both the left and right stereo inputs on the camcorder. Works great! Exactly what I needed. Nice, just what I wanted. worked perfect for me on an important shoot. Make sure you know what this does. Dont get the wrong one. Love it Works great!! Excelent product. Just the stuff that I was loking for my camera to use with a microphone... Exactly what I needed and thought I was getting. Worked well and cable material/length was just as described. Sounded well, although I'm sure most of all cables are the same in this respect, and did exactly what I needed it to do. This is working just fine, and I've had it for several months now, just fine Good cable You can't go wrong with Hosa cables and connectors.  I use my Hosa cables for patching between wireless receivers and my mixing board.  \"0\" failure rate with moderate to heavy use. Great price and great quality. No issues to date and no faulty connections to the units i use this with. convenient ! The reason I ordered this cable is because I got a condenser mic, and wanted to pipe the sound into my computer. My mic only came with the connector that goes from the mic to the phantom power, so I needed to get this. This is the connector that you plug from the phantom power into your computer or into your video camera. At first, I accidentally got the wrong one, so make sure that you get the right one for the right thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess you could try to plug this directly into the condenser mic, but it probably wouldn't work that great without power. This is one of the best connectors that I have ever used. It's seriously great. It doesn't rattle around at all, and it supports awesome quality sound. I got the 5 foot one, but I really like that it comes in different lengths. Does what it's supposed to do. It's a midi cable, not a whole lot to say really, It's 20 foot long and it works without any issues... Excellent product and seller. I really like this cable and I'd buy versions of it for different purposes regularly because they are very affordable and of solid design. Just what I needed for the PA. No problems so far after about a year Good quality cables. I stand behind these cables.  I own several Hosa patch cables and they haven't let me down yet. I got this to see if it would work with my Korg R3's mike cause the mic as it is just doesnt sit right.  Also got a stand together I can put this vocoder any where I want.\n",
      "Have had absolutely no issues of any kind.. no noise, no static nothing Got this for my Yamaha EX5 keyboard to connect to my Motu Audio Hardware. they work great and built well also. I like HOSA products in general because they have a great quality and competitive pricing. I bought this to connect my Midi Pro adapter (for use with xbox 360) to my Roland TD-20.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know how to rate it, other than it costs $7 and it works.  I'd pay that again if i ever needed a replacement.  It doesn't appear to be cheaply made, and i feel it will last forever, so long as i'm not constantly walking on it while it's on a hardwood floor My husband wanted to connect our two keyboards so that he could play the interesting sounds and tones from our Casio on his larger 88-key keyboard. We ordered two cables and they worked out perfectly despite being such an affordable price. The length was more than enough for stacking the units even without special stands. Good quality and the angled plug is great for remote miking digital cameras. Excellent.  Sometimes I must mount my microphones on client DSLR or camcorder cameras or audio recorders.  I need to carry multiple adapters.  However, I advise anyone ordering this adapter to read the very technical reviews at the top of the review list.  There are two types of XLR to 1/8th.  Read the specifications before ordering.  I did.  Their explanations are excellent. Works just fine. I have to say, this is a very good cable.  I plugged this to my Behringer Microphone and use it for interviews.  Sound is crystal clear and there is no ground, static or noise.  It makes good contact with the mic.  It is a real bargain!\n",
      "\n",
      "I highly recommend it. Excellent This is a high quality product.  Works with microphone as intended.  I am very happy with it.  Will buy again. I use this cable to run a extra line from microphone podiums to a zoom H1. This adapter has never failed me and has been instrumental in capturing quality audio at live events. I own several of these and love them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I highly recommend this adapter to any visual or audio professional. Also check out Hosa's sinlge XLR to double XLR splitter. AAAAAAA++++++++ Does exactly as it describes. Can't beat the price either compared to other online music instrument distributors out there. Have no complaints about this product and will definitely buy again when I need some. I've been a fan of HOSA cables for some time.  Good cable and great price. Affordable and dependable. Better quality than a lot of other similarly priced cables Good product Great for my handycam. I use this to connect a mic to my GoPro 3. Works great! Nice! It's a perfect means of using a hand mike with a DSLR. The audio comes out crisp and clear equally on both channels. If you can adjust audio levels on your DSL, lowering the volume reduces the AGC hiss while retaining good audio presence. I used this to connect a lavalier microphone to the 7D camera. It is long enough so that you can be away from your subject. I generally use this with my sennheiser lav mic system when I film events. This works really well to swap the lav mic with and then with another XLR to 1/4 inch adaptor I can plug right into a board and get direct wireless audio. Great product! Works great.  I used this for school. Just right if you have a shotgun mic you want to use with a video camera that mounts on the camera. I use this to connect my keyboard to my Voicelive Touch.  Works great, no problems.  What else could you ask for? Midi cables in the local music shops are outrageous.  A simple DIN cable carrying digital signals, not subject to the same kind of losses that an analog audio cable might have.  Yet they want as much as a monster cable for them, ridiculous.\n",
      "\n",
      "I picked up this one for a 80% discount off of the local prices.  I will be back to buy more if I need it.\n",

      "Don't buy the hype when purchasing digital cables.  They either work or they don't there is no magic fairy dust that makes them work \"better\". I've had good luck with Hosa cables. Midi, patch, etc. Haven't encountered a bad one so far. It seems to be a safe brand, I just wish they came in colors. Works with Canon T3i to any XLR microphone. Great quality and no reason to give it anything less than 5 stars. Not sure if it mixes down to stereo or just mono or mono stereo. Will update review when I figure that out.\n",

      "www. TubbsMedia.com We have a Presonus StudioLive 16.4.2 mixer and a Panasonic TM700K HD camcorder we wanted to use to record our youth ministry services. Using different types of cables had caused significant buzz coming out of the board's AUX (line-level) outputs. We had the same problem with a Canon XA10 in another venue, but had used a DI box to convert the TRS 1/4\" output to XLR while cutting the signal down to mic-level. However, the Panasonic doesn't have an XLR input, so we thought we would need this cable to go out of the DI box & into the camera. To our surprise, we could connect it to our mono output on the board (after cutting down the signal strength with a small knob next to it on the board) & run it directly to the camera without having issues. We don't have the flexibility of making a separate mix through one of the AUX outputs, but we also didn't have any AUX's to spare.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a long explanation, but hopefully it will help someone, whereas it took me many hours of searching online for an answer. i highly recommend this cable & will start using more HOSA's in the future! Nothing fancy, just a nice, solid, well-made cable.  I'm confident this will last, stand up to normal use and serve me well. I ordered a few of these cables but have only opened one so far, and have only used it a couple of times.  Nevertheless I've used a lot of cables in my life and these have the look and feel of quality products.  The connectors are solid and well-molded.  They have good strain reliefs.  The cable jacket is thick enough that it should be able to stand up to regular use.  The cables are thick and comfortably pliable without being wimpy.  Unless there's some hidden weakness that I can't spot from the outside I fully expect these to last me for decades. Very good. First, the reasons why I awarded this five stars: the construction is uniformly excellent. Both ends have strain reliefs, the 1/8\" connecter perfectly mates with the plug into which I insert it, and the XLR end is a quality component.\n",
      "\n",
      "I purchased this specifically to transform the third channels in my&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Powerwerks-50-Watt-Personal-P-A-System/dp/B004VQDAQK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Powerwerks 50 Watt Personal P.A. System</a>&nbsp;into something more useable. This greatly expands the functionality and versatility of the portable PA by allowing me to plug in another mic. Since I have three of those units daisychained I was able to significantly enhance the entire system with this simple adapter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason why I love this is it's noise free. In some environments in which I play there are sources of electromagnetic interference that cheap cables will pick up and transmit. I have not had that problem with this one, so it's another plus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall I am very pleased with this adapter and actually purchased a spare in case I damage or lose my primary one. It's a bit pricier than others I considered, but I feel that the quality and peace of mind are worth the premium. Got this cable to run a rockband keyboard controller to my M-audio profire 2626 to control midi in Pro Tools. Works great! Firm fit, solidly molded ends, reputable branded cable.\n",
      "\n",
      "(a bit on the thin side, but i haven't seen to have any issue due to this or anything. Couldn't go wrong for $5 at the time of my purchase and prime eligibility. These are the same exact cables offered by that guitar place and other such places. These are great quality MIDI lines, and I haven't yet come up with anything negative to say about them. In fact, the only downside to ordering here is that you have to wait to get them. For the price though, you could order 2 or 3 of these here for what just one would cost at the other places. I use this cable to connect my old circa 1980's keyboard to my computer and it works just fine! Like totally awesome dude! Cable is perfect for connecting my korg triton le to my profire 2626. Nice and lengthy to reach across my space. These cables are built well and you simply can't beat the value.  A great addition to my home studio.  Highly recommended. Hosa makes great cable products The ends of the midi cable look and feel like quality. Connection is secure, no worries about uneven connections, it also detaches without a hitch. Highly recommended. Used this to hook up a Rockband3 MIDI Pro-Adapter (which does not come with a MIDI cable). It worked fine. This cable works very well for my midi devices.  It was a great price and connected to all my devices.  It was long enough for my needs. It gets audio from my outboard microphones into my Sonoma GuitarJack 2. I got the 1' version. Quality sounds good from a first impression. As long as it holds up, I'm satisfied with the purchase. The listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo XLR is.  Stereo XLR is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones, where left and right are separate unbalanced wires.  This cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced TRS cable.  This item is not a mono balanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced mic cable.\n",
      "\n",
      "A little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping #3 to pin #2 with the white wire.  Pin #3 then ties to pin #1 with the ground wire. I know there is a lot of fluff and stuff when it comes to 'which' cable goes into the 3.5mm stereo jack on your camcorder or DSLR.  Well - this is the one.\n",

It works perfectly and the Tascam has plenty of gain to get the mic up to a decent recording level.  Super convenient! As advertised...well made. Works for me..! Excellent product!

      "Build quality is good, and since it's TRS, the signal is very clean. Works perfectly for my needs. Have 2 of them - left and right - and it sounds great. What can I say? These midi cables don't cost much but they work very well. The plugs make no pretensions of being thick and that allows them to fit easier in most cases. HOSA makes great high-quality cables, and this MIDI cable is another shining example.  I'm using it to connect a Behringer FCB1010 to my MBox 2.  These cables come pretty tightly packed, so bake them in the hot sun for 30 minutes to get rid of the factory coil.\n",

      "UPDATE (8/2014):  I am STILL using these MIDI cables years later, and they are holding up like champs.  They've been tossed around and mutilated in all sorts of bags and cases. Well made, XLR 3 pin adaptor to mini.  Needed to get a real XLR mic into the computer and this did the job. I tried the same product with a male jack at the end from the same company, but it didn't work; this one did via a female-to-male adapter, and works fine. This cable is of a surprisingly good quality for this price and is actually much heavier duty than I expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 20-foot length allows me to connect a MIDI drum kit to a MIDI keyboard in the studio and worked perfectly from the moment it was plugged in. The cable is of good quality wire, and the connectors are well constructed. Very simply, this connector will not introduce hum or noise into your setup. Highly recommended. This was the cord I was looking for--splits mono sound across the stereo input in my Canon 7D and 5D m2--solid, no breaking up of signal like some cords I've used.  I would have been happy with a shorter lenght, but it serves me fine.  Does the job-- A really fine Hosa product that exceeds expectation at a great price.  Quality construction.  This item performs as advertised.  A great value! Worked properly Good so far I used this to hook up my SM58 mic to both my NEX-7 and my NEX-VG10 and in both cases it worked great. Just received this cord and it seems to work as expected. What can you say about an adapter cord?  It is well made, good construction and sound from my DSLR with my mic is superb. Bought this to hook up a Beta 58 to a Panasonic G2 DSLR and a Kodak Zi8 for interviews. Works the way it's supposed to. 90 degree TRS is a nice touch. Good price. Use these in my Rack system and have not had any problems over the last 4 months I've owned them. best cords ever, heavy duty quality... Nice Needed new interconnect cables for my studio and these work perfectly. Good product at a good price. Works great! Thank You! Hosa makes great cables - no exception here.  High quality, has withstood the rigors of mobile/wedding DJ use. good These are cheap cords they break after a month! works great, very affordable. Your basic xlr to 1/4 trs cable.  No issues, works fine. Quality cable for casual use. These are the cables you need to connect the XLR outputs to powered monitors. Perfect length. does the job, same as 5 x more expensive, do not waste your money Not much to say here: The cable is good; noise levels are low; connectors looks pretty decent; holding up well so far. yes Works great and looks good.  I originally purchased this as a small snake but it ended up as patch cords. I'm using the non-balanced version of this snake.  It seems to be of typical HOSA quality, which means that all connectors are molded in.  It's nicely made and works fine. very solid construction, very high quality jacket, they seem to be great quality, I will buy these again when needed Excellent cable.  Good price.  High quality.  I highly recommend it.  I have a few Hosa cables now, and they're all very nice cables.  I think they're made in China, but they appear to be made well. PERFECT........ Amazing solution for my rackmounted guitar effects.  Someone suggested that I get a 1/4\" snake to connect everything in my guitar effects rack to keep things organized and neat.  This does the trick.  Seems very sturdy/ durable.  Price was not excessive. The only snake I'll touch. Great sound quality! I use this as a patch cable for running individual monitors in my home studio setup. They work perfectly and I haven't had any problems in over a year. If I need something similar in the future, I might get this again. Perfect for my limited home studio needs.  I've used many Hosa products and only a very few have failed.  And that was only after a few years of use.  Very affordable. The package arrived quicker than expected, and without damage. This cable snake was a welcomed addition to my recording studio. And the price was a good deal for the HOSA cable brand.\n",

      "I bought this for use with my Roland TD30-KV drum kit, allowing me to use the 8 semi-separate outputs to send off to the PA system. Actually, I plug this into a 8-channel isolation transformer (By ART), which then feeds off to the PA System, to eliminate hum/noise, and, to turn the unbalanced outputs into balanced XLR to go to the mixer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyhow, for this purpose, this works perfectly. I currently use this as a connectivity snake for my 16 channel mixer board to the amp rack, which has three power amps, EQ, and Midiverb. Perfect length to leave in the Anvil power rack and hook up to the mixer board which sits on top. I never have to worry about digging into the rack to get everything hooked up, just grab the open end of this snake and hook up! great for running an interface to a mixer, or a mixer to amplifiers. normally if you run more than four cables, things start to get a little messy. a recording snake like this one keeps things neat, color organized, and cost less than it would cost to buy eight 6.5 foot cables.

Item as described At this writing, I've used this for a few months of regular gigs and practice. The built-in cable tie keeps it from being tangled, the decorative jacket has held up well and still looks good after 15 or so shows! Should last if I take care of it. I do prefer replaceable ends like these over molded ends so that is a bonus for me. I really like these \"tweed\" cables and have several on hand...I'd get more when needed. Super reliable and durable. Just get it. Great Deal Perfect for my guitar Best guitar cables ever. Very dependable high quality music cable that's highly durable and flexible. Prior to this I had a very high dollar fender cable that wasn't as flexible and durable and broke with a few weeks. I've had this Hosa for a few months doing the exact same thing the fender cable was doing and to my surprise,  the Hosa is not only hanging in there, but it doesn't even seem to be no where's tired. HOSA PRODUCES HIGH QUALITY DEPENDABLE CABLES Great quality product from a great seller. I have 4 of these cables in my studio. I have had them out on the road when we play out and they have yet to fail. I am very pleased with the quality. Can't beat the price. I love it!! high quality cable, worth it... This is such a great cable for your guitar. I use it for my for my electric acoustic guitar. It is very durable and it accomplices the color of my guitar. Love this cable. So good and yet so affordable! Works well. Great transaction. Item as described. great Works fine. Is durable I especially love the cloth on these cables as they seem to pick up less dirt and dust compared to the usual rubber style cables. Seems of good quality but as with guitar, speaker and mic cables, only time will tell. Not a bad price and I like the woven wrap and the metal plugs! Good design and workmanship it appears! Great deal if they last 6-10 years! uality cable with no hum.  Does not kink up easily. Excellent Product.  Very Pleased. Everthing ok totally worth buying to get free shipping nice product awesome product work great no noise would buy again This is a great cable that doesn't really kink or knot as many rubber-insulated cables do. It also slides easy through the mess of other wires, pedals, and amps that it gets tangled in. I really like the classic look though it is a very modern shielded cable. It is as quiet or quieter than any other cable I own, and at the price, this is a very good deal. My practice room has 12- 4' x 4 bulb fluorescent light fixtures- yes, that is 48 light total. They are the old kind with noisy ballasts. This cable just doesn't let that stuff in, though. Very good shielding for $16 at18 feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, I am not used to using 24 gauge conductors and probably wouldn't if this cable was longer than 18 ft. That would probably be my only knock and it isn't really a knock since it is appropriately sized for the length.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a pro cable (gauge question aside) at consumer pricing. The plugs can be opened and checked or re-soldered if you ever have an accident or need. But, from my short use over the last month, I don't think I'll ever need to open this cable. Buying two more today.\n",

Verrrrry nice! Excellent guitar cable. I've been using it everyday! Nice construction and perfect length for playing around the house. Good quality cable, good connectors, amazing price. This guitar cable is very nice.  It looks high quality and has the white ends.  Fantastic deal for this cable. At the purchase price, I could not pass up the insane deal. The product is top quality. Try it out at Guitar Center to see for yourself. I love the tweed design.  The cable is exceptionally long, almost too long for my needs.  It is very high quality, sturdy, and looks great.  It's a thicker cable and feels well-made, especially for such a great price.  I will definitely go with Hosa for all my instrument cable needs from now on. Super nice cable.  Sounds great and the wrapping allows me more movement and less binding and tangles. Really high quality, doesn't tangle easily, looks cool, and the angled plug is less stress on both the cable, and your amp plugin I like this beautiful cable. Great price /performance relationship. Compared with other cables that I owned it has a low tendency to twist. Looks great with my J-45 This seems to be a well made cable. I just ordered another one. No problems. Cable works well. Tough and reliable. I've been using this as my main gig-cable for 6 months and its only got a few spots where little teeny threads are coming loose. It still looks fairly new.  Folds down nicely w the velcro strip. Perfect cable. Might just order 6 of them one of these days and replace everything else because they're all annoying and this one does nothing wrong ever. love it works great excellent unit Hey guys and gals,\n",

I'm not doing anything requiring that level of harmonic replication, so I really don't care one way or the other on that. Looks good, works well, quite functional and nostalgic. There were several complaints about kinking easily, but this is solved by leaving the cable extended for a while so it can regain it's coiled memory. Then coil it in the diameter it wants to be coiled. I prefer woven cables for looks. They have a nice stage presence. Hosa has been a very reliable brand for my cables. I don't move around on stage so the 18 feet gives enough length to connect to my mixer. This cable is just a little stiffer than some I have but that's OK for me and I'm sure it will wear well if you move around on stage. The quality is good and the jacket differentiates it from all the other cables you probably have. I recommend it. Obviously, quality sound transmission is what counts with a guitar cable, but this cable really is a good looker.  Very nice. This cable is amazing. I love the quality, the look and the tweeded mesh texture. There does not seem to be any noise introduced by the cable. I use this cable on a regular basis. I prefer it over my Monster cable. I see no signal difference between the two cables. Save some money and go with this one.\n",

      "Use it on a Taylor 414 & Martin GPCPA4 acoustic Guitars I bought this cable because I couldn't find any of my old cables. The 90 degree guitar jack is always a plus, and the tweed jacket is timeless. It doesn't twist or tangle nearly as much as most cables, and for the price, you really can't beat it. I've been playing through this cable now for several months with no issues whatsoever. I highly recommend it - you're not going to find another 18ft guitar cable of this quality for less than $20. what can you say -- hosa makes great cables at a great price.  this cable is well makes and is very quiet.  connectors are of high quality.  recommended. excellent Works pefecktly this cable is awesome thick cord really high quality jacks highly recommend this better then any plastic coated cable I don't have problems with it tangling like I saw on one review Great quality product. The cable is nice, it won't tangle, but if you roll it up it is difficult to unroll. If you move around while playing it won't twist like a rubber cord will. Sound quality is very good. looks really cool and sounds great.  no buzz or unwanted noise with these cables, and they have a velcro strap which makes it easy to store them when you are done.  i like them a lot. I really like this cable., It is a great, quality cord that is very durable and I think it would be a long time before I would need another one. The length is long enough for any need and the cable will obviously be around for a while. works perfect! I love these cables. I ordered two about a year and change ago and they are my main cables for my bass and guitar rigs. They are still perfect and they get used for many hours each day Great cable that looks great and functions properly. Connectors are very good and cable appears to be well made.\n",
      "Glad to have this when I'm jamming...not so sure the neighbors are happy about all the loud music but I'm sure they would agree the cable works as advertised! The product was great for the money I would recommend and purchase again LOVE THE TWEED JACKET! IT GIVES THE CORD EXTRA PROTECTION FROM GETTING STEPPED ON. LOVE THE MOVABLE VELCRO WRAPPER. CAN ALSO USE IT TO WRAP AROUND SHOULDER STRAP FOR EXTRA SECURITY. LOVE THE REINFORCED END CONNECTORS. PENNY FOR PENNY , THE BEST CABLE I'VE EVER OWNED! Really and outstanding quality cable at an affordable price. The fabric outer sleeve will likely make it last longer than cables using other outer material. Cords work great.  Bought to run sound to a mixer from my Sapphire pro 40 in church.  Works great! excellent quality and service I use this to hook up a camera to an older mixer that only has 1/4 outputs.  Works well and didn't break the bank- it's all I can ask for nowadays. This item is as advertised.  Arrived quick.  Was packaged well.  Would recommend product and store front too.  Wanted Rean connectors (Long story), but they do the same job. Cable works well. Works as intended. Does the job. 15ft was the length I was interested in - for use in my home music room with both electric and acoustic-electric guitars and ukuleles. THis cord is quite lightweight and resists getting twisted up. The connector swivels are smooth and firmly mounted. There is no audible interference or feedback caused, sometimes, by cheaply made cables. For the price, there is simply no good reason to not go for these general-purpose cables, Great guitar cable for anyone who needs as righty angle plug. We use it for the fiddle and it works like a charm. Good looking chord too. I like tweed jacket cables because they are hard to get tangled up and are easier to identify than having a bunch of standard black cables everywhere. I use the right angle side to go into my effects pedal board and the other side to go into my guitar. The right angle is nice because it's low profile and fits perfectly on my board, even when I put it in it's travel case. Everything seems well built here and has been working for months without any problem. got 2 of these for the wife and I.  the tweed jacket is very RETRO SHEIK!  works like it is supposed to!  the 90degree angled jack works great on the guitar end! This is a freaking awesome cable.  Way better than the one Guitar Center managed to convince me to buy years ago, probably for twice as much.\n",

      "Using it with a Sawtooth amp and plugging into an Epiphone and a Washburn.  Both sound great.  Basically the cord is too good for my amp, but I'd rather have a good cable than a good amp and garbage cable. Quality electronic cables I've been using HOSA cables for quite a few years and find them to be professional quality and very dependable without being overpriced. I particularly like the right angle plug. It works well on most guitars except Strats and Strat style guitars. That's still not a problem because I simply put the right angle plug in the amp and the straight plug in the guitar. This cable is far more flexible than plastic coated cables. I'm very pleased with it and recommend it. I received my cable this morning and couldn't be happier with my purchase.  First of all the delivery speed was amazing.  I placed my order about 48 hours ago.  Secondly for the price you pay this cable seems amazing, granted I've only gotten to practice with it for about three hours, but it seems to pass a signal really well.  It appears to be well constructed: solid tweed cover (Which I much prefer to the old rubber coating), longer rubber reinforcement jacket near the plugs than the other low-end guitar cables I've had, and a Velcro tie to keep the cable together when wound up is a nice touch.  Overall I would definitely recommend this product to anyone and will be sure to update this review if I end up having any technical problems with the cable. I like it, got it fast and it is just the right length for my at home personal use.  Thanks for getting it to me so fast, and I recommend going through the vendor I received this from it works great. Love the material, and love the vintage feel/look of it. It works great and for the price you can't get any cable this nice for that. Came very quickly. I'll be buying a few more soon. Good price for great product Works perfect! ok We all know good guitar/bass cables are ridiculously overpriced - but this one isn't. What it IS is a solid, quality cable that's noise free and looks great. I use mine three times a week for gigs - and the thing's SOLID.\n",

      "Sometimes, you HAVE to pay more to get more - as a professional musician, I get that. But in the case of this HOSA cable, that ain't the case. Working great so far. I've long believed Hosa to be a really good cable that didn't cast an arm and a leg. I'm reasonably gentle on my gear. I discovered Hosa when I found their short patch cables to use w/ my effects. Now, whenever I'm looking for any type of cable, the first ones I look for are Hosa. They've been reliable through numerous gigs and all the practices between. I would confidently recommend these to anybody looking for a quality product. Now, like I said, I'm easy on my gear, cables included. I don't know how these will hold up if you're going to stomp on them, jerk the cable ends around but, I don't know how any cable will hold up to that type of abuse. You may want to consider some wireless system if that's your case. I've used Hosa for years, they have never let me down. All their cords are quit and are quality produces. I have never had a Hosa go bad on me. Great guitar cables. I have been using these heavily and they have shown minimal wear and tear. Sound is still very reproducible after about 5-6 months of heavy use and i do not hear any crackling or fuzz from the wires. Great cables for the price excellent Stilling jamming Works fine so far. Basic, simple, works well. Good cable. They work, don't tangle up bad, and pretty easy to work with. very nice cables Works as expected. Works perfectly so far. What can I say, it does what I need it too! Now if only I would practice more and not be the suck. Haha Plug it in!!!! I needed these. d Love it! Good cable but haven't walked on it enough to say more. But out of the box it is what I would expect for the price and the strain relief look pretty solid. I know there are monster cables and sparkly prettier ones but I felt the girls at the club wouldn't be apt to notice the guy with the coolest guitar cable. Also I have seen the expensive ones fail as fast as the cheap ones so I always look for economy in disposable stuff like cabling. In short worth the money. I've used Hosa in the past and it's been reliable. It looks like they're using Switchcraft connectors on this cable. So far, so good. If it fails, I'll be back to let you know. This is a good cable at a good price. It arrived quickly. I purchased it for my Roland drum set. I am able to play Rock Band with my electronic drums instead of the cheesy drum set that is included with Beatle Rock Band. Reasonably priced and they work fine. The world of Midi is not simple, but you can do amazing things with it. I just ordered three more of these. Excellent cables! LOVE THIS CABLE IT HEAVY AND WORKS GREAT FOR GIGS Nice cable. Exceeded my expectations. Very good quality cable, perfect length. Very happy with this purchase, and I'd definitely buy again. Good quality and length. Works perfectly!  Nice for a stereo connection I/O to O/I Good Price for good product. Would order from seller in future. Quality, and better than fiddling around with two cables. These just work. Hosa cables are pretty reliable and these are no exception. Good quality cable, does exactly what it's supposed to do.  Nice and long, so if you need it on stage or studio, you're not limited. Great product. Works amazingly. These are high-quality and appear to be solid. I have had no problems, and it is very intuitive to have two cords connected since you have to use an in and an out with midi anyway. great product...........perfect for what I needed in my recording studio Very good product. tough, durable and economical to use that I give. 100 percent recommended for the purchase of this product. This product was just what I wanted and super fast shipping. works well and serves it's purpose. Really great cable. Perfect length when moving around and offers great sound quality. Highly recommend. It works All good Plugs right into my guitar. Awesome. These are exceptionally good cords for the price. Works great! When the cord arrived I realized that I bought the wrong style. The quality seams good. I will get some use out of with my ovation. never used it, but looked like a solid cable. These are great cables. It is a good quality cable, but I did not anticipate how short five feet is. Not the cable's fault, I just didn't engage my brain when I ordered it. great cable at a great price! This is a great, cheap cable.  Bought for my daughters to learn guitar with their mini squier strats.  No problems or concerns with these cables as of yet. Works well and affordable price. I recommend it. Havent had any issues and I have abused the guitar cable quite a bit. Ill buy it again Works great, no problems.  I use it to connect an Epi ES-339 to a Line 6 Spider IV 75, no problems in 5 shows so far. Well priced, aesthetically was exactly what I wanted with my black and white contemporary set up. Good quality too Thank you!!! Timely and I got exactly what I wanted. Great product. It came as described and works just as you would expect. The price was perfect, shipping was fast, and i would defenitly order again. Needed some cables after giving out mine to my grandson to use for his guitar, these were Amazon's top pick on the 10 foot cable. They do not disappoint, excellent quality for the price, better quality than some of the higher priced ones. Works like a charm using for a cable to my pedal box, clean sound and solid connection Solid durable cable with decent quality connectors. The cable sounds great. I haven't had any issues with it and I've been using it for months now. Exactly what I needed, works very well. Product as advertised. good Great product, reasonable price. Works well I have purchased several cables of different configuration by Hosa, and they are high quality flexible cables at a great price! Not a lot you can say. It was the right length and worked fine. 2 straight 1/4\" guitar plugs and a 10' shielded cord between. Very nice cable for the price! works nice cable Yeah, cheaper than the rest and great quality. I don't know if it makes any difference in the sound but it cuts the money going out towards gear. Lightweight and still tough. I like the quality of this cable. Hosa makes great, low cost, guitar cable. I am very impressed with my purchase. The cable is properly shielded, so I don't pick up a lot of distortion. Compared to the Planet Waves cables that I used to swear by, this is equivalent in manufacturing but 1/3 of the price. Definitely recommend to all of you DJ's and Guitar Players. cable is good, shipping sucks. even if you are prime. ok Works great. Thanks No issues here. Useful guitar cable.  Delivered on time and as described. Good product! Easy to use and as decribed Excellent.  Exactly as described. Exactly what i needed to connect to my DAW For the price this products is great.  It performs the task it was made to do.  Though one may pay more for this product, none will be any better. good cable Great cables Well constructed and seemingly durable.  Does exactly what you need it to do without needing to pay an exhorbitant cost. great cable would buy again very good quality Works great, no problems. would recommend it. It's well made and I received it on time. Perfect It is a simple cable and it does exactly as it was designed to do.  Everyone needs an extra cable for hooking up amps or pedals. No problem with this  cable. Purchased many of these cables in different lengths. Have yet to have one problem with any of them.\n",
      "However, they haven't helped my ability to play a guitar one bit! Works fine. just what i needed exactly as advertise great Cheap, soft (easy to handle) and works great! works well. no noise in line. Excellent Sounds great. It's a cable. Great for music instruments and strangling those that don't like your music! Cheep too. ok No issues with these instrument cables. Hosa has always impressed me with their quality and price points. I will never spend $30+ at Guitar Center for cables again. It's an essential item if you have an electric. It's not very long, but I didn't need a long cable. I don't notice any static or crackling while I'm moving around and playing. Transmits the sound exactly as expected, all at a great price! Works as advertised. Very pleased. This cord is great, works as it should and is really durable. good cable No complaints. the sound is good and I have never had any difficulties with them. Works just like it should. Affordable guitar cable that gets the job done.  My husband plays a lot of guitar and goes through a lot of cords.  This one has no complaints from him so far. no problems fast delivery great cable So far so good. Excellent cable good product still in use 1 year later Well build Great Product Works great with my Berhinger X32 board. I am using this whith my Shure X2U and togehter they are a perfect match to capture sound from the monitor L/R outputs. great Just what I was looking for! Great cable! I though I would give this a try.\n",
      "The price was reasonable.\n",
      "I liked the fact that the plugs are repairable, and I was hoping it was more flexible than the cables I already have.\n",

      "Also, unless I am crazy, it seems like my guitar sounds better.  Clearer. Item as expected, great value. No Noise says it all for me. Great price for a high quality cable. Perfect, as expected... no complaints... does what i need it to do... Ditto looper to Amp... great for the price,..no issues for now Hosa makes great cable products - very happy with the male and female splitters I bought from them So far so good Perfect Nice sound, no connectivity issues. I am happy nice Really nice supple cable. Good ends. Looks to last. These are very handy when needed  Good quality for the price Works perfect no issue. Great! Good product and a good price. quality product works great A+++ Thank you!! Well made!  Great price Awesome Very nicely put together cable. I was surprised at the quality for the price. Certainly worth the price paid, and probably could go for more than they charged me for it. Great quality!  Great price! NICE CABLE FOR THE REASONABLE PRICE,EVEN BETTER THEN I EXPECTED. No complaints. Serves the purpose I purchased it for. I would purchase again. Does what its made for This works great for 2 identical microphones when singing karaoke.  You need extra software if you are connecting directly to your TV.  I recommend Kjams since it has a volume control for the microphone and music separately. as advertised Perfect as Described !!!!! who is editing my reviews down to one or two words?\n",
      "DONT contact me again asking for reviews if your going to change them\n",
      "Write them yourself. FO! Good value! works as expected Thannks Good cable. I have a fender cable that's supposedly \"noiseless\" that hums, and this one doesn't make any noise. Great Cable - Great Value - It Rocks! Works great with our Peavey and Fender amps and guitars. Very flexible and doesn't tangle easily. Should have bought more when they were on sale. just right My first time buying this brand, but won't be the last. I play in a working band and I am very happy with the quality of these cables. Very good Just as described - so far - really great purchase! this worked perfect with phantom power to let me use 2 studio condenser mics instead of one.  sounds great with NO hum on the skype test calls. Great Product I use this cable to feed the stereo signal from the headphone jack on my laptop into a JamHub Greenroom system in a rehearsal space. This cable has solid connectors on both ends and adds no noise to the signal at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only complaint is that I wish HOSA also made a 20-foot version of this cable! great Great music. So far, it Works great. Does what it's supposed to do....decent quality for the price. Very happy with this. perfect splitter!  Make sure you get the right one because i've seen other ones that have it backwards. works very well, good quality for the price I have several of these cables and have had absolutely no problem with them. On the other hand, I splurged and bought a Monster cable a few years ago. It's now got a break in the line, and when I contacted Monster, I was told I had to have the original store receipt to get a warranty replacement. Who holds on to a receipt for a cable? These are just great Great. came as described Working well as expected. I use this cable to connect my VOX combo to it's slave 2x12 cabinet and it performs flawlessly. I am a big fan of HOSA cables (have 3 of them now), as they're tough, very well made and aren't nearly as expensive as other comparable products! I can honestly say that in my 35 years of guitar playing, HOSA cables are the best I've ever employed. Quality! We all need extra cables in a pinch.  Nothing fancy here, straight plugs (no right angle) at a reasonable price so you can afford to have extras.  I like the length, as 10 feet is a perfect amount for almost any application, be it plugging in your instrument or going from component to component in tight areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "5 stars, an excellent value! I got this to plug three mics into my USB interface instead of two.  It works great; I don't know why I never thought of using one before. excellent As expected Best bang for the buck! I use this cable to split two xlr mics into my mixer for a podcast. Works well and is of good quality. Good for the price Good cable. Works like it should. good quality cord for the price. It doesn't get tangled easily like the hard cables do Amazingly, the product works perfectly, I recommend it to everyone. Great product we looking forward to getting on the road and having every piece needed for the gig. God bless! Perfect product love it  Perfect solution for small problem.  I actually like the short cables so less tangle from the 2 incoming mic cables. Great product at a great price! I'd order again in a heartbeat! perfect amazing product Been using 2 of these for a year with no problems. Good value Decent Guitar cord.  Does what it needs to do. Great cable. I have some friends that use and like this cable as well. I'll definitely be buying it again. Great experience. Fast shipping. Perfect size good Works as designed. Used it with 2 mics plugged into one channel on my crate telluride acoustic guitar amp and plugged guitar in another channel. If your low on inputs and need another vocal this works great. I did have to turn the volume up a little more than I do with a single mic cable. Just in case. This cable produces a very responsive signal. It works very well. I have been using it for a few months now and it is holding up fine. Perfect, as described and great quality Great quality, works perfect. Very happy thanks:) Works well These work. works just fine You plug it in, and sound comes out the other end. I bought it to get free shipping on something else. Figured you can never have enough quality guitar cords. Looks and feels sturdy. what can I say ? product does what it is supposed to do and does it well, I will buy again Ran out of room on my 10 channel mixer. I needed to hook up one extra mic. This Y jack XLR did the trick. Good length, nice quality. Super cheap cable, does a super job. Still going strong today. It's a no brainer to buy one! I'll definitely purchase more (if I have to!!) Very happy I can finally hear my music! Great cable! sometimes you need this kind of cable.  works as expected. GREAT a very good cable and a good price I had to buy a cable from guitar center since this one didn't get here the same time as the guitar.  The other cable from guitar center was the cheapest 5ft and was 10$  after 2 weeks it started making noise and sound bad.  Ones I plugged the Hosa (which is 10 ft and for less money) I was dumbfounded how beautiful it sounded and it's so quiet when you mute the guitar!  Very nice cable I'm so surprised that it costs this much.  I'm getting more if it so I don't run out Works perfectly. perfect Works fine. Great cable at a great price Nice and cheap Good quality adapter. great Good quality. Great cable, great price This product is great quality and meets my needs exactly as I had hoped for. Love the material & workmanship these are mad from! Works perfect. No complaints Superb adapter, especially for guitar players who deal with 1/4 out from pedals to 3.5mm auxes or vice versa. (Eliminating the separate adapter piece eliminates SO many potential weak/failure points.) Exactly what I needed to upgrade my system. A shame they don't make them in the USA anymore. works immediately as expected, no issues with fit, etc, will buy from again When you need to lift the ground, this is the best way to do it. It's a really nice cable! nice cable Wonderful cable, exactly as advertised Does what they advertise. Used this to properly record sounds from a tablet app -- worked flawlessly. good product Very solid and works great used with SHURE WH20XLR headset mic for direct XLR to PA. Worked fine at our gig perfecto It works! Great reliable product! Easy to use and assemble! Good dual banana at a fraction of the cost of Pomona. No, these are not that quality level but 80% of the quality at way less than 50% cost. Works fine. As advertised. Solved my problem. Good These work okay. Works great. Thanks So far so good:) TOP,,AMAZON SELLER,,10/10,,BIG,,THANKS,,() A great buy no static good quality Not much to review here... is wired properly and it works. Great cables for a good price! Works as expected. Well made, worth every penny Good and working well so far Have a few cables, needed another one , so gave this a try, works very well. It is clear and no buzz. I've had these since January 2014 and haven't had any issues. good Did the job good adapter This came in very handy when I needed it. It's a Guitar cable, nothing more, nothing less, and it works. It was all I needed and am pleased with it. it is of a good quality way These 5-footers work great, and hold up better than I would expect for the price.  I get consistent connections, and no stray signal interference.  Hosa has been a workhorse brand for me and I keep going back to them whenever I need a reliable cable for gigging and practice.  No complaints. Great cable. Even better price. Gets the job done. I don't notice any static or popping. Excellent quality, works perfect No Complaints. Product arrived when promised and serves the intended purpose. I would purchase again. .i was surprised to see it is TRS. that is a plus for me. Recording Voice Overs. Switching between XLR and 1/4 Inputs... Because, i only have one mic. it has held up, so far. ...it is Not, Loose or Floppy.  it is Solid.!  Works Great.! works as designed too... great adapter. Thank you very much. If you need it you know what its for. For the price, I really didn't expect these cables to be as nice as they are. They are the best deal going on instrument cables. Does the job and is inexpensive !!! For the price, you really can't go wrong. These are the same types of cables you can buy at Guitar Center but are half the price here on Amazon. Anytime I go to Guitar Center, I ALWAYS check the Amazon price first, not only to make sure I'm getting a good deal, but also to check the reviews. These cables are keepers!\n",

Great cable so far Great quality and serviceable connectors if needed. love the product, works perfect Works well, Good Deal Thank you So far, so good. My cables have tended to wear out after a year or two at the solder connection to the 1/4\" plug. First time buying this brandwill see how Hosa holds up, but I'm almost 3 months into this one with no problems. Great Looks even better in person. Be careful to not drop your phone so often because the rhinestones will fall off (duh). More of a decorative case than it is protective, but I will say that it fits perfectly and securely on my phone. Overall, very pleased with this purchase. When you don't want to spend a whole lot of cash but want a great deal...this is the shop to buy from! It is a very cute case. None of the jewels have fallen off and the bow is glued on very well. Came in the time frame that was given and I'm happy with this purchase. The only thing you might want to know is, I carry my phone in my jeans and it does fit very tightly because it is a big bow. You have to be careful but worth it. Another great product that my daughter she use it for a long time but now she has the iPhone 5c. Transaction went well and fast. Beautiful quality and outstanding product! Everyone compliments me on the case and thinks I spent wayy wayy more than I really did :) It is such a good case for a low price. I have it on right now and never had any problems with it besides losing about 2 stones since my purchase because I'm rough with it. I recommend it. Super durable and I get compliments on it daily.  I found one like it at charming Charlie's for 25.00 way to high.  I'm happy with this case I have used this case for a couple weeks & so far its been great!  All the little blings have stayed in place.  Very sparkly & cute. I chose this case because it is so beautiful.  Everyone likes it and asks where they could get one.  Of course I was able to tell them where they could get it.  Beautiful! Of all my cases this is the one that I have on my phone right now I love,love,love it fits great so pretty and femine here is another I love as well!!!, I am so happy with my phone cover,, I get so many compliments from other females!!!! but it is my phone that wears it!!!! This case is soo super pretty! This case may look very breakable but it is very sturdy. It is super cute, the case looks cuter in real life than the picture. SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?? GET IT!!! This is a great case if you love the bling.  I get a lot of compliments when I use this case.  Would recommend it if you like prissy & pink! Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new.. if it is missing they replace it. BEAUTIFUL.  This instantly transforms your IPhone into a thing of beauty.  I have theone with the white bwe, too.  This is just great when you want a little color on your phone. It looks like I actually bedazzled my phone.  The case is better than what I expected ... it is so cute.  Yes, I would recommend this case. It is so cute!  Love the bling and love the pink!  It is such a cute case and I get many compliments. THIS IS A VERY PRETTY 4S CELL PHONE CASE ANS IT IS 3D AND VERY PRETTY, THANK YOU FROM RENE I ordered this case for my daughter for Christmas because she got an IPhone for Christmas and I wanted her to have a really nice phone case that was different because EVERYBODY has the same IPhone cases. SHE LOVED THIS PHONE CASE FROM THE MOMENT SHE OPENED THE PACKAGE!! I loved the fact that this case came a few days earlier than expected and THE PRICE WAS AMAZING for a really cute 3D IPhone case too. soooo cute! I got many complaints when I had this cover.  I took the gems off at the bottom of the case since texting made it hard.  After awhile, the gems started to peel off..but it still looked cute! Got this for a friend who saw this and liked it. i got it for her, and she liked it. looks good on your iphone and fits well too the hirl that wants and needs Hello Kitty products\n",

The product is recommended for anyone looking to use it or gift it to one of your family members. Thanks As this is a gift it is truly the perfect gift for a \"girly\" girl. I would recommend it to family and friends. so cute love this...one drop and its done though...i dropped iton the bathroom floor and it cracked. other then that item is very cute gotten so many compliments, its so beautiful and simple. i've had it for 3 months now and it still looks brand new This case is very pretty.  It is very girly looking.  The only problem is it will be hard to put the case in a jeans pocket because the bow does stick out.  It would not be a problem for me as I carry mine in my purse, but my daughters put their phones in their pockets.  Shipping was as described. really lie it a  lot but lost three stones already should have come withe some extras and glue as others This case was an extremely great deal. The color and design was perfect. This is a great going out on the town case. I get at least 10 compliment a day on this IPhone 4s case. Its just perfect, especially for the price i got it for. I have a white i phone 4s and with the case, it just so pretty. love it! :-) this is the most cutest case i've ever bought from here , i just got it today .. it took a really long time,which is weird cause it took almost two months. but i didn't care. i thought that it was gonna fall apart. but it didn't it really held up nicely. & i am thinking about ordering the other ones that come in pink & black. these are really classy & rich looking for only 2 bucks you can not go wrong. its so girly,even though i don't like too much stuff going on,on my cases. this i perfect, i haven't tried fitting it in my pocket but i will  sooo. you should definatley buy this. Received this item very quickly. The design is even more vivid than expected. The cover is soft (rubberized) but durable. I have received many compliments. It was an excellent buy! I would recommend this to anyone wanting a \"good look\" for their phone. This item was as described even arrived before expected. Would buy from again. Perfect transaction getting ready to purchase from again I wanted to highly recommend this seller>I had a slight issue with the product, and they offered a complete refund without having to send the product back:) I fixed the case, so there was no need for the refund. Thanks for being an honest company!!!!!! Good product, good price, fast shipping Simple to install and a great way to help protect your phone.\n",
      "My wife really liked the ability to change the look of her phone. my daughter liked it for a few days and then i didn't see it anymore on the phone. Use your judgement on that one. Its rubberized doesn't look like it in the picture but it is It's really cute I love this case used it for awhile but I switch out cases like I do my shoes. this is a great product, product shipped extreamly fast, no problems or defects with product, recommended buy for anyone. A+ Received this in about a weeks time. Very nice actually considering how cheap the price was. It's a pink/purple with black leopard spots and has a very nice feel to it. I haven't tried to remove it yet, but hopefully it won't give me any trouble when I do want to change covers. it worked perfectly from my phone I have a galaxy s 2 from Sprint I purchase this for a backup at work.  It charges my SGS4.  I would recommend this charger for the Samsung Galaxy S4. Shipping on time.  We'll packaged.  Charges like a champ! Definitely will rapid charge the Galaxy 3 with no problems.  Definite must have with a phone happy teenager Bought as a spare charger for the house and turned into my main charger because my other one failed. Nice long cable and has held up for tons of charges for my Galaxy S3. so far no problems, it charges fast that is what i need it. it doesn' have an USB as it specified, jus a direct wall charger. Works well. We use this for travel and it lives in our luggage most of the year. For the low price having an extra USB charger this works great. Charges our Galaxy S3 and Note 2. This Charger is awesome! First of all I wasn't expecting it until between 12/12  and 12/17, but it arrived on 12/11,So That was a plus for me! Second, I was kinda skeptical about purchasing it because it says that its for a Galaxy S and Blackberry so that can mean a lot of things! but I figured what the heck its cheap, so what can I loose!  Well, I just got it today and decided to give it a try at work on my Galaxy S4,  it charged  from 80%  to 100%  in about 7 minutes!! Yes i timed it!  and also the cord is long which is a plus for me!  So if your looking for a fast charger with a long cord and not to mention a great price, this is the one!!\n",

      "update:  not sure what the other reviewer meant by saying these are poor quality chargers, because I've had mine for a little over 2 weeks and it's still going strong!!  Love this charger  especially  for the length!! This charger woks wonderfully on the Samsung Galaxy S4.  it chargers the phone fast and the price is great!  Highly Recommended product! what can i say? pretty much like all the travel chargers for my galaxy 2 phone. price was the best what a great product!!! !Samsung Galaxy S2 Phone OEM Official Travel USB Charger (Detachable, comes with OEM USB to Micro USB Cable)!\n",

      "I have to say it was great and was worth the money!!! Very good product and shipped in a timely manner Excellent product ordered two more after first arrived Works great!! Good item very good price. idk Excellent Excellent quality! would recommend to all! Pretty standard car charger from Samsung. Cant go wrong with it. Charges my S4 well. No issues faced till date. Nice thanks! It work properly for my sister 1 luving it  right now will last about 4 mo so you cant beat the price for it I got 4 of them I like this charger. It's great for traveling. Also, when your phone is low on charge and you're in traffic, it comes in handy. Thank you excelente I got it for one reason... PRICE  and it does the job.  I am able to keep my phone charged while on the go. The big store that is in every town now (can't say their name) either does not carry anything or is always out of stock. If they ever have anything is stock, it is cheap junk that does not last. I got this cord thru amazon for a fraction of the price I usually pay for the junk at that big national store. This cord works perfectly and has lasted for months now. I also bought at the same time 2 other cheaper charger cords thru amazon that work perfectly. Since this one still works, I have the other two to fall back on when this one finally goes out. This is a great car charger, and it does not cost near as much as the junk you get at the local store--not to mention this is the Samsung brand charger verses their junk. Need to be able to recharge the phone...what can I say. I love that it is universal. I can use it for other phones even though I got rid of my Galaxy long ago. Works great, excellent CS good good Needed an additional home charger for my Samsung Galaxy S2 phone.  This charger is exactly like the charger I received with my telephone and works perfectly. Works great in my car. Charges my phone pretty fast (as long as im not using it) Ive had this for a few months now and haven't had a single problem with it! There isn't much to say about this charger.  Its an official OEM charger for the Galaxy S2.  It fits and works perfectly.  Now I don't have to constantly transfer my USB charger from house to car and back all the time.  Its a nice convenience. Replaced my daughters old charger. Does what it's supposed to. Very happy with my purchase Excellent EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED AND FOR THE PRICE, IT'S GREAT.  TOTALLY RECOMMEND IT Excellent, Arrived on time, item as described. very good product. I needed a car charger and this was very affordable and it works\n",
      "great! The same thing from the store was three times the price. Works as expected This charger works perfectly.  It is the official Samsung charger so I was sure it would work just fine. I highly recommend it. fast delivery, works well. Not very long. I love it.  It charges my phone quickly and the cord is super long.  I leave it at home but will purchase another to leave at work. Works great!!  Shipping was on point!!  Need to order more soon. This detachable sansung galaxy s2 travel charger is simply good. It works perfectly.  The cherry on the cake is because it is longer than the factory original l received with the phone. I was looking for an inexpensive charger for my device so I looked on Amazon.  Found this one and bought it and it is doing the job just fine. It is Samsung brand..works with my Android phones..Galaxy Nexus 4 and Galaxy S2 and S3...recommend it highly for anyone with a microUSB phone I found that this cable actually does transfers from the computer faster than the OEM version. Also has a nice long cord and more sturdy at the point of connection. This charger works great. I love the fact that the LED on it does not light up until it is plugged into the phone. Great bargain. I use this charger with my GS2 from Straight Talk.  This charger is working as expected, charges the phone fine and seems like a quality product, not flimsy and cheap feeling like some chargers I have ordered in the past. es un cable para carro de excelente calidad , original de samsung , lo tengo algun tiempo sin ningun problema OEM is the way to go, fits the way it should and no shorts on it. Definately would recommend. Price is right This Samsung Travel Charger for Galaxy S2 really charges fast.  It really does not take a long time so if you are in a hurry it goes pretty quickly. This charger is exactly like the original one that came with my phone.  It is most definitely a good buy for the price! Finally a real oem charger!!!!! The phone charger was great. It looked exactly like the charger that came with the phone. Great for the price. Cord is a little short and loves to retains its coil, so don't think your are going to be able to stretch it out. A very good car charger for your phones, charged my phone pretty quickly and quite affordable, I recommend it to anyone to have as a back up to your charger. I like this charger because I don't have to pull in and out of the socket in the car.  When I plug the phone in ut turns on.  When I unplug it goes off.  Saves the wear and tear of the car socket. Received it promptly and it worked perfectly for my phone, even though I had ordered using the wrong phone model. Thank goodness Samsungs are very similar in charging.  Thank you I needed a second charger to take with me on vacation. I got this in 2 days, it charges both my phone and my kindle fire. It does it's job, so that makes me happy. Great product as advertised an original OEM part. Works great. I used this on both my cars and have not had any issued with it.\n",
      "Will recommend this. thank you. it did not disappoint. was as expected and does the job though I am going to a new phone as the galaxy 2 has been acting up consistently. shutting down by surprise etc... It's good item and reasonable prices.\n",
      "And I received it short enough in time.\n",
      "I hope all your business going well.\n",
      "Thanks I got exactly what I thought i was getting. Brand new charger! and the price was beyond awesome!!! thank you This is the first battery charger that I have ever owned that charges the phone super fast. I love it! it's a charger for dirt cheap and the shipping wasn't more than the item. I wish they had the batteries i needed as well for my phone. but great all an all I just wanted a charger like the original one from Galaxy phones, and this one gets close.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a bit bigger and the USB cable is very stiff, not very flexible.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm using it with a Samsung Galaxy S2 (I9100) without any issue. The only difference I have noticed with this charger is that the cord is maybe just a little less pliable than the charger that came with my phone.  I can't seem to get the cord to straighten out completely, but that is just cosmetic.  It functions perfectly.  Have used it plugged into my charging base as well as directly into the phone.  Would buy again. great charger  works perfectly, product made well and made to last. if you need a charger for your driod x  this is the one to get Has held up well as it gets used by teens,mom and dad. Charge rate is acceptable . thank you. It fits perfectly. Seems substantial. Doesn't seem to increase the slimness of the evo 4g lte overly much.  would buy it again if I needed another one. This is a great phone case for a great price.  It snaps on really quick.  It takes a bit to get off but comes off nice.  Very nice pattern. This is actually the second case I've bought.  I got one just in case I ever break the other so I don't have to search around.  My phone has taken a few minor falls, and this case has done its job. No damages to my phone.  I like this particular design because it's classy, complementing the Evo LTE.  It's slim, so it doesn't make the phone larger than it already is.  It provides better grip than just holding the phone case-less.  It's easy to put on.  A little more challenging to remove, but you don't want a case that is falling off.  With Evo LTE having no battery access, it's not often that I need to remove the case.  It's got all the proper cutouts to accommodate any of the buttons and plug-in spots. this charger is amazing. Fantastic long cord and it charges the phone beautifully. I bought another one on Amazon it was slightly cheaper it was junk. It has a micro USB end not a full USB 3 chordfooled it does work and it works well I am very satisfied with this product! It came in the appropriate packaging. It was also a very good price! Also they are very helpful and have great communication! It works good, the light is quite bright, but if you turn it upside down it makes a great subtle interior light. Finally...one that actually works in my car for my Samsung Note 3.  Charges fast. Very satisfied. I have the Samsung note 3 and due to high phone usage I use this charger a lot. It charges quickly and I do like the blue light when its connected. It does what it says. Works great! it works and the cool blue light is neat and helps to show its on. It does work and well... i just want an instant change from 9 percent to 100 percent in 5 minutes... but hey, thats just not gonna happen with any charger.. for the money this ones a keeper! Order shipped quickly and was exactly as advertised. Works great no problem. I like that it charges mine note 3 n my husband's galaxy 4 phone. No longer have to keep different chargers in each vehicle Thank goodness I read the reviews and was aware of how to plug it in.  What is nice about this is that it also fits my sons phone.  I have a Galaxy Note 3 and he has a Galaxy S4.  We can share one cord when traveling.  Yay!  Can't comment on the speed at which it charges.  Have not needed to use it yet. Great Item,\n",
      "\n",
      "I have an s3, its an old phone so the battery is crappy at times, this case not only protects the phone for me but also helps me not have to worry about keep charging my phone. Love this! The HTC M9 is a beautiful phone, but I have a lot of issues with the battery lasting just for part of they day. When I am at the office I have it plugged in, so it is not an issue, but when I am off, like on the weekend and running around and not able to plug in, the battery is at 50% by noon. This battery extender is a life saver. In the past, I have used a power bank, which means I have to carry a cord to connect the power bank to my phone, so that is added inconvenience. Also, it is awkward to use my phone when it is plugged into the power bank. This here is a great alternative since I am able to (very easily) slide my phone into the case, making it feel like I am just carrying my phone, instead of three items. It is very light weight and adds a little length, but I don't find it an issue. I have used products similar like this in the past and this one is very slim compared to others, which where bulkier and heavier. I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest review. i love my case ALSO A XMAS PRESENT & VERY FAVORABLE.  I LOVE IT Very good Nice This is absolutely amazing, more than doubles my battery life, so I can forget about carrying my charger all the time.\n",

      "For such a good price, this is just the right deal. A++++++++ Good case good battery couldnt watch movies on the htc without the battery dying. the phone is great for entertainment. but battery could be better. the powerbear cases is a great fit and a good kick stand on teh back for entertainment. im sold Great Product, Looks sleek and lasts for 3 days without charging. I love It! Received this case very fast.  Looks and feels great, much more sturdy and heavy duty than others I have had.  I have now used this battery case on 5 rounds of golf.  After 4-4 1/2 hours of continuous iphone 5c use I have 100% of the battery on my iphone and still have about 50% on the PowerBear.  Great unit Great love not having my phone so much. I bought 2 of these to go on my children's phones. I love them because the \"I had a dead battery\" excuse no longer works! Thank you PowerBear! This extended battery case makes me last almost 2 full days. This is way longer than I ever anticipated. Quality product for an amazing price. The S5 battery should come stock this good! great item for a really low cost now thats a great buy . Easy to use and give me enough power to last the day. can't beat the price Last twice as long as the standard battery, but obviously takes longer to charge. Definitely worth it for the extended battery. Makes the phone considerably larger and heavier but didn't bother me at all. Definitely not waterproof anymore but I lost the charging cover anyway. There's decent room next to the battery to store some cash. The cover is two stage: One clicks onto the phone and then the rubber case fits snug over it. The rubber case has started to get a little loose around the sides of the phone but isn't too bad. Some larger 3.5mm headphone jacks won't seat properly but the charging port does not have this problem The extra battery  helps to prolong battery life well satisfied would recommend to others. Case fits to the 'T' on the S5, and actually feels a LOT better in my hand, with a little thicker pone body.  Battery performance is excellent, and I use it ALL DAY - EVERY DAY for business.  WHY Samsung didn't make the S7 with the extended batter option is a mystery!!!! Just got this in . So far so good .  The case is nice makes it easier to hold. Will let u know more after more use Item exactly as described.  I've only had it for a day.  After installing the battery, I charged it to full capacity.  It is now sitting on my table.  It's been there for well over 5 hours and still has 93% charge remaining.  This is great, but I purchased it so that I can use it on a GranFondo bike ride.  The event will last over 7 hours.  Time will tell if this battery lives up to its claims.  I'll try to follow-up and give my opinions after the ride.\n",
      "\n",
      "These is a followup commenst:\n",
      "I used this extended battery for my 104 mile GranFondo that lasted over 7 hours (as I anticipated).  I participated in the same event last year and used the conventional battery.  That battery depleted after 5 or 6 hours.  With this extended battery, not only did it last the entire event, but it still had about 70% charge remaining after the finish. I had no problems whatsoever.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone.  Many thanks! Great Product and fit perfectly for my phone!  WoW.......does it ever increase the overall mah for you phone and I no longer have the need to find a charging option about mid day!  Great Product and no issues that I've been aware of as of yet! wow Very happy with thw product.. Amazing fast charger Graet...charging quick! Seems to work well.  No issues so far Works as advertised. Great product, great warranty 3x the battery life was nice GREAT BATTERY LIFE SO FAR !!! This thing works fantastic! No over heating goes all day with no charge. This is great battery solution for my phone. Provided about 4 times the battery time with no issues.  Fit my S5 great. I get a full two days of juice and I use it a lot. Definitely will buy another when I wear this one out in a year. Works like having 2 batteries instead of 1. Large battery requires use of the back plate they include which translates to your cell phone holster or Otter Box will no longer fit. Only drawback is you can't attach your phone to your belt. It lasts and lasts a good deal love I t Works perfect and it lasts significantly very long battery life up to two days on a single charge with regular phone usage! It doesn't make the phone very heavy or too big . I can go two days and more with this battery.  The black cover looks great with its design and fits perfect.  I am rewarded with a two year guarantee which I think is one of the best warrantee in the industry.  The price was a great value, and was considered very reasonable. fits great, looks good,nice product. awesome Makes me feel more comfortable that the battery will last all day and it does and more. It's great, I need one in white. Love the product.  It looks, and preforms as described in the posting.  I will buy from them again Nice to not be tied to a charger. OK This battery works as good as the zero lemon 8500 battery. I ordered another one. Box has 7800 battery, 5% off next amazon order coupon, two back covers one plastic and one rubber for cell phone, and a screen protector. This is my second phone but it holds a charge for days now. like 4 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "just looked at the charge. it was charge 2 days ago and it is above 90% still absolutely in love with this....... only negative is the protective case isn't as good as the one I had to remove for the battery, but I Like the extended life of the battery more.... This is an Awesome product! I went from worrying early on the day  (around noon ) about where I could plug the phone to charge it while using it at the same time, to not needing to do it at all until I got home to charge it overnight!!! This is a great product for the money. Far exceed my expectations. Not too bulky or heavy. Only wish the power and volume buttons had covers to make them easier to press but it only a small complaint. best on the market. can not go wrong with this brand. Worked good while I had the phone Received lightening fast, and finally, finally, finally I can make it through a whole day without charging.  The back feels great in my hand - I previously had a rather bulky cover, so the PowerBear back is not that much more.  To me, definitely worth the trade-off of losing waterproofing/resistance for a reduction in battery anxiety.  Loving it, and highly recommended. My wife got one, my Daughter got one, and now my Son and Son-in-law both got them. Very nice item I was changing my factory battery 2 times a day I seen this powerbear battery thought I would give it a try and I have to say I love it at the end of the day I still going with battery life thx so much u all saved from buying a new phone Delivery was fast and efficient. Package was in perfect condition and contents were complete and as promised. As to the battery itself, it certainly has a much higher capacity than the standard battery. It lasts at least twice as long with no changes in useage. It performs as advertised. I would highly recomend PowerBear! Really great product, feels nice & sturdy, truly improves battery life. I didn't benchmark it against the OE Samsung battery, but it seems like the original battery has been doing worse lately, and this thing seems to have at least triple the uptime capability of the original battery. great The battery, cover, and protective case fit very well.  Battery charged to 100% using original Samsung charger.  Battery life is now extended well beyond the standard OEM battery life.  This is good value for the money spent. Works perfectly for Samsung Galaxy 5. Lasts almost 3 days with moderate use. Very nice. It will be nice if I could have the item more than a day so I can evaluate it. although as I can say right now it's going fantastic. As I can tell I've had this phone for over 6 hours and lost 30%. Which I believe is fantastic. When I first got the Power Bear Samsung Galaxy S5 7800mAh extended battery I charged it over night. Upon turning on my phone there was a quick drop to 99%, which surprised me. I'd have thought there would not have been any drop in power for a while. It's been a week and I have been charging it overnight. I have been doing  a lot of political phone canvassing recently, which covers a 3 hour block of time and averages 65 calls.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the battery drops when on for a few minutes, any subsequent drop in percent is extremely slow over the 3 hours, so from 99% to 90% over 3 to 3 3 1/2 hours is more in line with what I had expected originally. Overall the powerBear package is substantial as it includes a new, deeper-profile, S5 back cover, a rubberized back-cover protector and a front glass protector, with a cleaning cloth and USB charging cable. Now, I am very happy and can say it is a good decision to buy the PowerBear 7800 extended life, battery package. Well-crafted and precise in all aspects of fitting and performance! O my this is amazing. 5 days of charge before i need to recharge. Fits in my belt pouch with phone in life proof case.\n",
      "Why can't we purchase phones with these big batteries. My brother is THRILLED with this and insists on 5 stars, which I'm also happy to give.\n",
      "He has an old S5 with a bad battery, but instead of buying him a new regular battery, I got this one instead, as a surprise.\n",
      "This just happened to be about two weeks before Pokemon Go was released, so clearly he needs it more than ever now ;)\n",
      "\n",
      "It does add bulk to the phone, as expected, but the snap on back case gives it a nice smooth feel and look, still. With the battery capacity being already nearly 3x more than a NEW original S5 battery, it feels hardly thicker and it's a great trade-off. It's not the thinnest, obviously, but I'm really surprised it feels nice and not as bulky as I imagined.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three pieces: the battery itself, the plastic battery cover piece (replaces your current back piece), and the optional rubbery-feel case part. My brother uses it without the case, so the back is smooth. He stopped using his previous case, since obviously it won't fit over the new huge battery, so that's one downside.\n",
      "\n",
      "We haven't calculated exact length it lasts, so I'm not going to give any technical info here,but as many times as he's gone \"HA! Your battery is at 45% and mine is STILL at 85%!\"... yes, we're (he's) happy with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing I don't love is that it makes it difficult to use the pulse oximeter on the back of the phone if you have slightly long nails, because of the angle. It'd also be cool if this came in a different colours, or came with a few different cases (since it makes it impossible to use other third-party cases). Otherwise, it's really great and I'm looking to buy one for my Note 4, now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought this discounted in return for my opinions and review after use. I've only had it a couple of weeks, but it's been so nice to not have to worry about my battery dying mid-day anymore. I can go two, two-and-a-half days now on a charge. I use my phone mostly for texting and web-browsing, some email, some Google Maps and Sky Maps, as a flashlight, a few non-intensive games; not a lot of phone calls. But with my old battery, same usage, I felt like I was doing pretty good if I still had 20% battery by the end of the work-day at 5ish.\n",
      "\n",
      "The phone is now heavier, but not by a great deal. I tend to carry it in my front shirt pocket, which tends to cause my shirt to sag (but for me, function tends to outweigh form), but that was true of my old battery, too. It's also a little thicker, too. So when I bought this battery, I also bought the case ($7-8-ish) that fits it, which I use some times, but I still tend to keep the phone in my shirt pocket a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the battery came a back cover (that does not have the NFC antenna in it, so NFC doesn't work; I really like the NFC feature, but don't find it easy/convenient/practical enough to use it enough to make its absence noticeable to me, at least so far), and a \"case\" that covers the back and sides of the phone. I was surprised to find that included; I guess I didn't notice it in one of the product pictures, even though it's there.\n",
      "\n",
      "If this battery lasts, in good condition, for as much as a year, I will be completely sold on this product, and will likely remember the name \"PowerBear\" the next time I need a battery.\n",
      "\n",
      "I offered to buy one for my wife, but she doesn't want to lose her cute pink case (for her, form tends to outweigh function - pfft). So while she wears out charging cables (and then taking mine - arg) fighting to keep her battery charged, I just go about my day, smug in knowing that I'm fine with whatever charge I have until I can manage to get to a charger later in the day, or maybe even tomorrow. So far, so good. My phone is getting the juice it needs and I am not in panic mode wondering if the battery is going to die before I can charge it up. This product gives me a lot more time with my phone. The 100% takes longer to get to 20% (the point at which I usually charge it back up). Thank you! As reviewed by other users here, I don't have to charge the battery for an entire day once it is full. I am a moderate to heavy user and i freely use all of my phone's features without having to worry about losing battery power fast. This is a review of a few items I just bought. As they are all related and being used together Im going to paste the same review to each product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently my Samsung S5 has been draining badly as the OEM battery started to come to the end of its life. I started looking around for a replacement and decided to get an extended battery. I have been using a wireless charging pad and I wanted to continue to charge with this method as I have several pads and even a wireless charger for my truck. The charging receiver I have been using was not going to work with the extended battery so I opted for one that plugs into the bottom charge port of the phone. Im not crazy about removing the door from the bottom of the phone but I cant seem to find a way to get everything I want no matter how many products I buy.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I settled on was the PowerBear 7800 battery and the wireless receiver listed in the link below, unless this review is the one for that receiver. I got and installed the Powerbear battery and two back covers. I first installed the wireless receiver and then popped on the hard plastic back plate. I then tested to see if the phone would charge on my pad. It did, on two separate brands of pads without issue. I then added the protective soft rubber back cover and tested the phone on the pads again. To my surprise it started to charge with both cases on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The battery and case backs feel of high quality and I really like not only how the two back plates look but feel. The extended battery and both plates do not add that much weight to the phone and the cases do not make the phone very fat. I have been using a LifeProof case up until this point so Im used to a larger phone. This case gives me plenty to hold on to with my man hands and still can be stowed in a pocket with ease.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make up for the lose of my Lifeproof case I also purchased a set of the Moko waterproof cases. They were really cheap and seem to be made well enough for my use. I wanted something that I could use on my boat and motorcycle. These fit the bill and the phone with both back plates fit in the case easily. I find that once you place your phone in the bag you can press the air out to get a vacuum seal. This makes using the phone much easier. This is also the same company that I bough 2 wireless charging phone holders for my vehicles. They work very well and are much better than constantly dealing with a charging cord.\n",

      "I have not had the battery long enough to speak to its power and life. If it fails me or does not deliver the powder advertised I will be sure to update that review.\n",

      "I recently took a trip where I had a almost 3 hour plane ride. I was watching movies the entire flight and before while waiting to board. I had the screen on full. I didn't have to worry about my battery at all. It lasted all day and I still had plenty of juice when I was ready to settle in the hotel room.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have also been able to use my phone while the screen is on full while listening to Pandora and using GPS on my motorcycle. I have not even come close to running the battery down yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I get up in the morning I don't even have to think about a charger and I do whatever I want on my phone without any worries. On a typical day of use I will end the day with still about 70%. On a heavy day after watching a movie and having the screen on full I might be in the 30%s. I have to really try to get in much lower than that in a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a great by and a great battery for travel. This Is my 8th battery 3 for me 3 for my wife 2 for my father 1.5 to 2.5 days battery life depends on usage. We all have external chargers our phone's stay mobile we are never tied to a charging cord battery goes dead change it out recharge the dead one. Lasts much longer than standard battery.  Wife seems happy with it. So far so good. Fully charged upon receiving and after moderate usage all day. Last night it was fully charged at midnight, so I unplugged it, and after almost 22 hours of moderate usage, it's at 77%. The past few days since I've installed it, the battery has not gone below 60%. That's usually from 5 am till 10 pm without being charged. I would really like to see these types of extended batteries for Windows Phones. This has really helped out my phone... It makes your phone thicker, but you get used to it quick.  Really good product for price.  I have nothing negative to say about it. Battery charger up really nice used it at work all day long and at end of the day still had 70 percent left great cover also I would definitely recommend it Just got a new Galaxy S5 and 15 hours later I'm still at 82%!! And that's with all of the updating amd swapping of phones Love it, maintains power much longer than some of the other brands I have used in the past. This type of battery is the way to go and would recommend to anyone. Works great! Works great and battery cover find snugly.  Great product Very pleased with this product. No more charging mid day now. I puchased this battery combo for my wife.\n",
      "Nipped in the bud all complaints from her not having a great battery. we love it This device is a life-saver. Well, at least an S5 saver.  My phone,  with the Lollipop upgrade, was sucking battery like a newborn. Worn this case/battery,  I can now go all day. Also,  it doesn't add that much weight. Thanks,  PowerBear! Great product. Yesterday I took my phone off the charger at 720am. After a day of pretty heavy use i didn't plug it back in until 230am and still had 22% left. Highly recommended product. Using 2 right now.  They seem to take the most charge of any extended battery in my external charger and lasts longer.  Probably buy a 3rd soon. Only had it a couple days seems great loved the fast delivery Great Battery Case, Lasts me nearly 3 days on the go. Also durable so I don't have to worry about dropping it on the floor. This device works well on my HTC M7.  High quality product. Quick charger, got it for someone else. Their old HTC charger would not charge quicker than the phone discharged and this one does. Also came with laffy taffy. Banana flavored, mind you.\n",
      "Also comes with the appropriate cord which works just fine. Delivered on time and works fine. The only disadvantage is 2 adapters which I have to use, but it's because of my location.\n",
      "Charging speed is noticeably fast and build quality is excelent.\n",
      "Overally great charger! GREAT PRODUCT LOVE IT GOOD PHONE ! STILL USING ! Great product for the money!  It really came in handy at Disney World.  As you know your phone battery will not last a FULL day at Disney.  Using the PowerBear we had battery life for the full day PLUS.  The PowerBear is a bit bulky but worth it!!! Works great! I am a real estate agent and when showing houses with my blue tooth ekey, my phone would always die!  This battery keeps my phone charged and is great quality!  I can get 2-3 full charges from 10% minimum using this battery case.  I love it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update:  I have had this almost 2 years and use it all day most every day.  This and another one.  I charge one battery case while using the other battery case and my phone NEVER goes dead.  I can do whatever I want on my phone, leave all my apps open, keep my phone bright as I want it, leave Bluetooth on, whatever.  These are a MUST have for me.  I like the battery case much better than an external battery and it offers some protection for my phone.  I put tempered glass screen protectors on the glass and pretty much covered.\n",
      "\n",
      "I highly recommend this case as it lasts about twice as long as the other because it's almost 5000 mah and my other one is a little over 2000.  I like that these come in the same color as my phone.  It also makes my phone easier to see and on the back of the phone it has a lever that allows me to stand my phone up horizontally or vertically.  This one takes about 2 hours to fully charge I think.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line: I love this case, it's lasted 2 years and works as well today as the day I got it.  Buy it now.  You will not regret it!!!! I bought this for my 15 year old daughter who is taking a school trip to Mexico next month thinking it will probably come in handy since the battery on her 5C is doing good if it lasts for 8 hours.  It arrived quickly and I was definitely impressed with the build quality for the price. Her phone fit nice and snug and there was a positive click when it reached the plug on the bottom of the case. The top part of the case was a perfect fit as well and it snaps shut with a very firm grip on the phone, but it does seem like it will be a bit of a struggle to remove it.  For those that will leave it on their phone all of the time this is a moot point of course.  She plans on testing it this weekend to see how long the battery will last and trust me, she is a very heavy user. The 4200 mAh rating seems to be a bit of a stretch and in theory it should last almost 3 times longer the phone battery which I believe is rated at 1,507mAh.  I will update this review when I hear back from her and then again after her trip.  Oh yeah...she loves the shade of pink I got her. Great Product, the battery lasts me more than 2 full days without charging. Considering that I am a heavy user, this is great. The back piece also sits very sturdy. Awesome charging case!! I've referred lots of friends to buy one!! I simply cannot believe the power this battery has given to my phone.  Like so many others, I was ready to get a new phone since I had to continually charge after 2 hours.  it was driving me crazy. The battery lasts all day, and then some.  I just wish I had this months ago'  I am in the very beginning stages of using this, and hopefully this great performance will last. This comes with a 30-day warranty, so be sure to register within 30 days.  The phone, as everyone has said, is heavier.  The case is sturdy and fits well in the hand. Battery last long. But it also takes long time to charge it. It will make your phone extremely thick. But I got used to it and I'm ok with it. Although it now looks a little out of style. Battery does what a battery should.  Prompt shipment.  Would purchase again. Works really well as a battery life extender. Purchased this for my son's phone, and he can go a whole day without a recharge.  Having had an S4 for a few years myself, I know it's tough going more than 4-5 hours without finding a charger.  This goes a whole day of rather heavy use and still has some juice to spare at bedtime.  Plug it in when going to bed, and you have another full day of bliss. A battery is good as long as it lasts and charges the way it is supposed to.  After a few days I have nothing bad to say about this battery.  My old one was over heating the phone and not lasting very long.  This battery is fixed those problems...so far so good.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other battery I bought about a year ago and they don't seem to be in business any longer. Recommend to have working well . ** Updated **\n",
      "It's been little over 7 months now and it's still strong and I still love it!  Very similar strength as when I first got it.  I can definitely go through a full day without worrying about the battery.  With average use and not much of game play, I can still almost go for 2 days with this battery.\n",
      "===================\n",
      "** Updated **\n",
      "It's been about 100 days now since I used this battery and it's strong going strong.  I never have to worry about running out of battery within a day and it almost gets me through 2 days even now.\n",
      "===================\n",
      "Based on my 4 days of this battery, I am very satisfied with this product as of now.  I just hope this continues to be the case after 6 months or even a year.  Normally I would only have about 20 or 30 percent of battery left when I get back from work, but now I have about 75% left. I no longer have to worry about running out of battery for those days when I have to use the phone more than usual.  I hadn't dropped my phone, so I am not sure how well the case will protect, but it looks like the foam-feeling cover would protect the back and sides and since front side of the case comes up above the phone's face, it should protect.  I am use to bit of rubbery type of case. This case doesn't give as much as friction and grip that the rubbery type of case gives, but gives enough so that it's not slippery at all.  The back hexagon pattern makes it look like women's case.  I wish it didn't have any pattern.  But then maybe this pattern is added to help with not slipping.  It is much thicker with extended battery cover and case than with regular cover.  But not thick enough to bother me or carrying it in my jean pocket. I reckon it gives the extra power back up ! will come back to review again, but don't be afraid to buy. A very nice case that fits perfectly around my phone! Very soft to the touch, but durable and strong enough to protect your phone from any damage. It's protecting my phone in style! my girl was surprised when she got her new case loves to check the mail to see if she gets more phone cases My new battery life is considerably better.  Love the fit, and the case and screen protector are a very nice bonus! This is very pretty and ubber functional on my phone!  I couldn't see spending a fortune to cover my phone with an ugly otter box, this one does the job and is gorgeous! I didn't choose this color but it's not bad. Stunning look and protect. I would recommend it to some people who like's flowers. This case is so beautifully made I am ordering every color it is well worth the money. I was looking for a quick replacement but this turned out to be one of my best purchase at Amazon. I highly recommend it to anyone. I like the design of this case - though I am a tomboy. It is very artistic.\n",
      "I must note that it is kind of weird seeing how the design on the front does not merge with the design on the back (see the picture closely - the blue and white are on opposite sides). Weird, but not highly noticeable. Still, it is beautiful and I used it regularly (for about a week and a half until I got my hybrid silicone and hard case with a stand). The blue and gray combination with the stylish design on the case are a great fit for my galaxy sii! I have received several compliments on this case and have been ask when I bought it.  It is a nice case with a great look. She fell in love with the design. She says it's a better quality than she expected for the price. She wants to buy more soon too. Exactly as described, wonderful battery life. Dear Lord in Heaven! Where have you've been all of my life PowerBear LLC! I bought this for my dad's AT&T Galaxy S4 which was using a cheap knock-off from eBay. Yeah I know, WAH WAH WAAAAAHHHHH! But seriously though, this is BY FAR the BEST replacement battery I've ever seen/experienced with it. My dad was shocked at how long this battery could hold a charge for. The thickness of it is absolutely not an issue. In fact, it gives the phone a more sturdy feel to it. PowerBear LLC, you've made a powerful impression on me with this battery. I'm bought & sold for your business. Thanks & Happy Everyone. Peace! Love it. I fully charge my s4 at night from about 9-6am. Normal use will get me to 9pm again with about 20% remaining.  This is usually about 3 hours streaming,  2 hours reading (those together), some normal calls, 10 texts. Original battery would not make it past 3pm or so. Also provided case is easy to hold and seems  to  provide  good protection. Added 11/27. I now have another of these batteries so that I have two to take camping therefore I won't have to worry about charging. They do last a long time as noted above however with the new battery they recommend this recalibrating process by which you charge to 100% And then take it down to zero then back up to 100% Etc every so often I'm going to try doing that every 6 weeks to see what happens. I still really like these batteries Sturdy and very pretty.  Great product at a reasonable price Just love it.  Had ordered several at the same time and this was absolutely my favorite.  Wish I had ordered a couple more. I bought this for my wife and she is very happy with it.  It fit well, looks great, and is holding up well.  She has drop the phone and the cover protected the phone well. Good quality I bought this for my husband. His original battery is worn. I'll update as to whether it lasted without having to be charged during the day I like this cover very much.  It is very beautiful and a great protection for the phone.  I recommend it. feels good to touch, isn't slick so it won't slip out of your hands. it has a matte finish. the first few times I dropped it out of my own clumsiness i broke one of the fingers that keep it on. lasted for about 8-15 drops before it wasn't usable anymore. It served its purpose and looked good doing it. FIT PERFECTLY, WELL MADE, COLORFUL, MY WIFE LOVED IT, I WOULD BUY IT AGAIN FIT PERFECTLY, WELL MADE, COLORFUL, MY WIFE LOVED IT, I WOULD BUY IT AGAIN =) Arrived quickly. Able to go 2-3 times longer before charging. Very happy with the results. like night and day. I installed this battery and boom now I don't charge the phone all the time. this battery will last all day and into the next day. I am on it constantly and the phone seems to be much more comfortable in my hands now. I purchased this PowerBear Samsung Galaxy S4 6000mAh Extended Battery & Back Cover & Protective Case (Up to 2.3X Extra Battery Power) - Black [24 Month Warranty & Screen Protector Included] as the battery in my Samsung Galaxy S4 was swelling and it was losing contact with the pins on the phone so it would always turn off or the battery would be all of a sudden dead and that was really annoying and inconvenient.  I saw this and usually I had to charge my old battery 3 or 4 times a day and with this one I can go 2 days without charging the phone after a full nights charge and that makes it very nice.  I use my phone a lot especially outside work so it is nice to be able to look at my battery life after a full days work and still see 90%+.  Even if I use the phone almost all day the battery still has life at the end of the day.  The screen protector that came with this phone battery and case fit perfect and was really easy to put on without any issues and doesnt cover anything like the speaker or mic.\n",
      "I received this at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and true review. I have never spoken to the company and they have never contacting me or told me what to say on the review. Works better then the wireless version the wireless version has lag and audio some times is laged behind also I think with with the wireless version there must be some compression going on or signal loss because the wired version the quality of picture is ever so slightly  better with high quality files Very good works well. Excelente Now my galaxy 4 is complete thank to this so now I'm can watch my movies on my TV samsung A good inexpensive cable that works like the original.  I purchased this cable because I wanted one that would work with the touch stone I just purchased.  After reading several reviews and looking at competing cables I deciding on this one.  While several inches shorter (40\") than the original it works well and with the touch stone.  I used this cable mainly for use in the car. Palm pre charging data cable works as advertised. No problems so far and that is a very good thing . this phone cord is so easy to use and easily connected from phone to computer. great value for the price. The phone end of the charging cable is the weak point of the Palm Pre and is NOT the standard USB end. The charger end IS standard USB and plugs into any USB charger or computer jack. The one that came with the phone wasn't making good contact. This one works perfect and the price was right. I bought this recently and did not expect much, as it was only $2.99 shipped to my door.  For that much money, how can you go wrong?  So, I have not used it to transfer data yet, as it it plugged into my PC at work just for charging.  When plugged in, my Palm Pixi prompts me, just as the factory cable does, to transfer or charge.  I have used this cable about 10x to charge now, and it works great!  Do not hesitate to purchase this if you need another cable, or two! There is a difference in USB cables.  On some computers, including mine, the USB ports are underpowered, and some poor cables do not transmit data well.  I have purchased some cheaper cables that would not transmit data between my computer and my Blackberry Storm 9530.  This cable works great, even with my underpowered USB ports. It's a standard microUSB 2.0 cable, heavy enough to charge the Blackberry phone, but it should work with any device with a microUSB socket; I bought it for a different phone, and it works great. Can't beat the price. I went to best buy and they wanted $15 for a new cable.  This purchase is totally worth it for anyone needing a replacement cable. This is a great little charger.  The only complaint I have is that the wire is a little bit thin but I'm sure it will last a long time if treated gently.  LOL compared to what they rip you off with at the Sprint store these are awesome deals. This car charger works well and does what it's supposed to, charges my phone. I do love the nifty feature of having the cable not hanging about all willy nilly. The pull back works well and isn't too fast. Sometimes when I find that my phone isn't connecting properly, I push the button to make the cord tighten and it works better. I don't always have the issue, so it's not that big of a problem. I think I got a lot of bang for my buck with this purchase. Works as advertised on both PC and Mac for the LG Vu. It also worked with my Samsung Eternity (using as Mass Storage and for PC Studio / TK File Explorer) with no problems. Arrived as expected, in new condition. I would recommend purchasing this over a higher-priced cable. I'll never understand how one review can say this item works exactly as it should and how the next complains about it not working...for the EXACT same phone! I just don't get it. I decided to try it out despite the people that said it didn't work, and I'm glad I did. It's exactly what I expected and wanted. I actually bought 2 of these so I could leave one in my car and one at work. For only $4 and some change for the both...this was a GREAT buy for me and now I never have to worry about my Incredible running out of battery! This is clearly not a HTC cable as it has the Blackberry logo on it and the bulk packaging label says Blackberry...but it's a OEM micro usb cable none the less and works perfectly on any micro usb device I plugged it into.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I haven't tested it's speed against other cables I doubt it outperforms any other OEM cable but it works and that's all I asked for of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cable is a bit thick and as a result is stiff but not unmanageably so.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should also be noted that the cable shown in the picture is not of the actual product, that is a mini usb cable and appears to be quite a bit longer than the product, this cable is 1m long. I have a GPS V that I really like and this is one of the best add-ons for it or any Garmin GPS.\n",
      "The GPS V comes with the required mounting bracket, and other models do too, but if not, you need to make sure you get it along with this.\n",
      "This friction mount is relatively small but stays well on all dashboards I've used it on. It's pretty flat so it travels well in a suitcase or carry-on bag. It allows you to position the unit in the most appropriate spot in the vehicle and then using the clap attached to the GPS, adjust the angle of the display so it's optimal.\n",
      "Detaching and re-attaching the clamped unit with the friction mount couldn't be easier. For such a small and inexpensive add-on, I couldn't ask for more. As long as there are products like this available to hold the portable GPS units I would never pay the price for a built in GPS on a car as an accessory. Fits anywhere,stays in place. I use it with a Garmin StreetPilot 7200, which is a fairly large, even somewhat clunky GPS with a large 7-inch screen.  The screen does vibrate just a bit when going down the road, but nothing major.  I have it sitting on the dash of an Armada, inside a slightly crevassed area just to the right of my steering wheel/main console.  It sits perfectly, so I can see it with my bi-focal sunglasses and still clearly see the road. I have had no problems with it sliding off or tipping.  It has a locking mechanism at the bottom, which I cannot slide over to lock the mount connection because the Garmin GPS is already wedged so tightly into the beanbag mount; no big deal though...doubt I would use it anyway, I don't see the need since it fits so securely without it. It is a well-made beanbag mount that I think will last a while and I got it for a great price here on Amazon. Works great. Easy to attach the GPS and easy to memove it. Stays in place when set down on the dash. Highly recommended. I purchased a Nuvi for our delivery trucks. The included suction cup soon became useless after a few months from constant changing of vehicles. Thanks to a purchase suggestion from Amazon, I discovered the friction mount. It is perfect, if the Nuvi must be used frequently in several vehicles, or simply removed from a vehicle often to prevent theft. D.A. Wolfe below is absolutely incorrect.  This thing does not shift at all.  I have no idea what he means by he has to \"baby it around corners.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great mount and keeps the unit from sliding in all situations.  I do off roading and it still doesn't move.  I have a Nuvi 360 and use it in a Tacoma.  It truly rocks and is easy to remove and keep in my console with GPS still attached when not in use. The stand works great if you buy the other stand and use them together.  Make's it pretty expensive but it works. woks great, the last one I had lasted for years, I expect that this one will too. fast delivery fast & accurate. Item works as described and love how the clasp is strong and also not made of plastic where it bends. love it perfect! exactly as described, on time, just the right thing. nice clip, just what i wanted I bought this item so I could keep up with my car stereo's remote control.  It was simple and easy to use.  Just peel the two-sided tape, attach to the back of the remote, insert the remote into the clip and clip the whole thing on the visor.  Just no better way to keep up with such a tiny item in my car!  Highly recommend! I am using the FreeSpeak for non-Bluetooth phones with my new T68i and I love it.  The Bluetooth multi-adapter for my old non-Bluetooth phone worked great, but the phone didn't support headset initiated call answering, voice dialing or call ending []a pain if you're going to be using any headset.\n",
      "So I got the T68i and I am finally enjoying true cordless freedom.\n",
      "As a note, I do notice that my range with the T68i is far less than with the Jabra multi-adapter.  With the adapter I got a good 30 feet of range from the phone/adapter to the headset.  With the T68i, I'm geting maybe ten feet, max.  Apparently SonyEricsson's implementation of Bluetooth isn't up to par.  But you can't fault the headset for that.\n",
      "Also, I think the belt-clip/charger needs some sort of positive lock to prevent losing the headset which with its light weight makes little noise when it's dropped and to secure its position while charging. nice Good Quality Product. Worth the money. Good Buy. Very Good and works well, will do business again guide Amazon.com Getting Started Guide for Wireless Service As described Excellent! I purchased this item a while back, but I remember that it was great item.  I would definitely recommend it. Good customer service.  never any issues.  great about upgrades.  Simple and Easy to get and new phone mailed and have simple instructions on how to setup your new phone. This was a lovely purchase the gift went over very well The item is still being used Love it Thank you This Getting Started Guide listed information and instructions on what to do with my new phone to get it working.  The Guide (it's one piece of paper) lists instructions for New AT&T Customers, Existing AT&T Customers and there is also a section for Troubleshooting.\n",
      "\n",
      "I followed the instructions listed under Existing AT&T Customers and everything went smooth!  My new, beautiful phone was up and running very quickly, with no problems! Yes when you get this paper insert, go to your fireplace, make sure your damper is open and then light a match to this baby and you will see the true value of this insert. I give it 5 stars for the pretty colors that are created when it goes up in smoke. This is one cool gadget.  Stuff that cost extra on my previous phone (data cable and software) is not needed here - I have an infrared port on my laptop.  My Outlook Address book transferred via infrared in seconds. The software to do this is free from Nokia's web site and installs in minutes. You can also do it with the BlueTooth connection (a BlueTooth USB adaptor is under 40 bucks!)  What I think is really cool, is that the phone is a modem for my laptop - again via infrared or BlueTooth. A also use a BlueTooth headset, and again, it was a snap to install.\n",
      "My only complaint - the darn ringers are way too quiet. I've missed calls with the phone only a few feet away, or on the car seat next to me with the radio on (and not that loud!)\n",
      "Apart from the retro-layout of the keypad and the huge (for a cell phone) screen, the phone also has another strange feature - no external antenna!  Yet the reception is great! I bought two of these phones in June.  One for the wife, one for me.  Signed up for the Family Plan to save $10 per month (share slightly less minutes with family members).  Rebates arrived in about 9 weeks as promised.\n",
      "We send each other pictures of the baby using T-Mobile's T-Zone service.  Very cool!  Last night at the Cards/Brewers baseball game in downtown St. Louis, I took a 15 second video of a Scott Rolen home run.  I then \"sent\" the video to my wife's phone and she was watching it miles away a minute later.  How fun is that!\n",
      "I check my work email account and browse ABC news, ESPN news, and CNN news at stoplights.  It even worked way out in the country on a vacation trip in July (Lake of the Ozarks).  With my Yahoo account I set up all kinds of \"alerts\".  I get breaking news, weather, etc.  Your phone will have an email address of its own so your friends and family anywhere can send you email.\n",
      "The Bluetooth capability is useful also.  I sync up my contact data with my iMac regularly.  The new version (iSync 1.5) even supports calendar synchronization -- all wireless.\n",
      "Games?  I play Doom, Star Trek, and a tank game.  Lots of fun..\n",
      "Doom takes some hacking to get to work on a 3650 though.\n",
      "The keyboard is goofy, but gets a lot of looks.  The only caveat is to be sure your employer allows camera phones before buying. I will not belabor the technical aspects of this phone--but I will sing higest praises to Nokia for making it available in the U.S. Now, if Americans would avail themselves of the data functions of this phone and not just the voice, AT&T, T-Mobile and Cingular \"Internet\" dl/ul prices would be cheaper.\n",
      "This is, simply put, the best phone on the market to date!  The camera is great, that it shoots short videos is amazing, and couple it with the very comfortable Jabra Bluetooth headset, and you have a true deal that even P.T. Barnum himself would be envious of.\n",
      "There are other phones with more vivid colors or larger screens, etc., but you get so much more phone than any other is capable of today (in the US).  You can't go wrong--and it's free!  How can you beat it?  You can't. This stylish -- uniquely so -- cell phone from Nokia is large but surprisingly light, and the color screen is one of the best I've seen on a cell phone.  The circular dialing pad does take some time to get used to, but likely not as hard as you'd think.  The ring tones are nice and loud enough for everybody, and the built-in camera is easy to use.  But T-Mobile ranks as the worst mobile operator in the country.  The German-owned company has sporadic cellular coverage outside the New York metro area, tends to overbill its customers, and has a user-unfriendly website.  While I wholeheartedly recommend the 3650, I advise you stay away from T-Mobile.  Get AT&T Wireless instead. No wonder it is \"Amazon's Choice.\"  For my new iPhone X, I bought several headphone adaptors from Amazon, and only this product works perfect with my earphone & selfie.  I returned other adaptors and bought this adaptor again. This is the original smartphone.  We shall pay homage. Cool phone I bought this phone a few days ago, and it is awesome!\n",
      "Out of the box, it is pretty cool(...)!\n",
      "Cool Features: Bluetooth, MMC Card [16MB included- but upgradable], large screen, plays any MIDI you can drop into it, IR connectivity.\n",
      "TONs of software: It runs Symbian OS, so there are lots of programs/games to install.  I have installed 'Active Desk' [a replacement desktop/theme organizer] and AgileMessenger [supports MSN, Yahoo, AOL, ICQ and other IMs] along with 'Extended Profiles' [lets you custimize when differnet profiles come on, or how long they last + more].  Check the Yahoo groups for 3650- there are several of them with lots of good backgrounds, games, ringtones, etc.  There are replacement web browsers [Opera, NetFront], screen savers, IR Remote software, and even a Gameboy emulator [haven't tried this one yet].  Hell, there are even movies you can download and watch on the unit [once you get a larger MMC card].\n",
      "Negative Features: Bad battery life when usign Bluetooth & IR excessivly, strange keypad layout [you get used to it], bluetooth learning curve, slow 'boot-up' [about 30 seconds].\n",
      "I have this connected via Bluetooth to my PC [with a few headaches setting it up] but I have been having problems connecting to my TG50 clie [need special drivers from the internet].\n",
      "So, at this point, I can check my e-mail, browse the web, chat on MSN or Yahoo! messenger [hard to do with the keypad- predicive input helps] and go anywhere in the US that T-Moblie has coverage [or most cities and interstates that have GSM 1900Mhz].\n",
      "If you like gadgets that you can tie into your computer, palm, car, etc. then this is the phone for you! This phone is worth every penny...i had an old nokia phone so i decided to upgrade & it was worth the money...it plays wav files as ringtones (it converts it to 10x smaller than normal wave files)...great sound,clear reception..has lots of games....i can play NES,gameboy color emulation also.....i also love the key pad...soo diff from regular phones..the only complaint i have it the 4096 colors on screen compare to most 65,000 colors on screen phone..but its great... Battery pack works, fits perfectly and cable/connector didn't present any issues during install. Great replacement battery, once fully charge the phone worked for two full days with regular calls. I've had it for many months and it's been working great.  Battery life is all I expected.  My old battery was dying all the time. Replaced 3 batteries for my cordless phone system. After a full night charge I was back up and running, Great! perfect Great. Nice! Good Good...The cell coverage has gotten better as far as talk, but the data service still is not working correctly and my MMS does not work right either. This is a carrier thing, not a phone thing though. EXCELENTE Works great. I don't think these actually increase reception but when I use one,  most of my smartphones will work in buildings with metal roofs - that comes in very handy when I am working on a project and can't break away from the garage often I purchased the Cellular Innovations because I have used them for about six years with my other track and Boost mobile phones and received great reception.  When  I would remove the booster from my phone my calls would not go through as well when I would be in buildings, basement, under bridges or other poor reception areas. I rarely have call drops and the reception is smooth and clear. I can get a call through when other people have to look for a clear signal. I noticed that with my new Boost Mobile android phone without it the reception was good but with it the service was great. I have purchased several for family and friends over the years and they enjoy the clear reception too. It is important that you handle the antenna with care; put the booster in your phone with clean hands; and must be careful in placing it in the correct location as instructed to get the  best reception. It works best if you don't touch the antenna with your fingers, Hold it by the sides or edge; smooth it with a smooth flat card. I use my small library tag. If you put the antenna  into your phone incorrectly it will not work. I like to keep one on hand for a back-up to make changes after about six or seven months of use.  It also makes a nice gift to put into cards for that extra special touch.  The booster is a must have for less expensive phones and a big help for my android phone. I get the best of both worlds, low phone fees, and great reception with the Cellular Innovation antenna. Thanks DO NOT USE THIS THOUGH IF YOUR PHONE IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY CUZ US CELLULAR SAID IT VOIDED MY WARRANTY, BUT US CELLULAR IS THE WORST CELL PHONE CARRIER OUT THERE. I SHOULD NOT HAVE EVEN NEEDED THIS WITH A BRAND NEW SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 BUT I DID...THE INSTRUCTIONS COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BETTER IS MY ONLY COMPLAINT t h a n k s  a l l  g o o d  i n  p e r f e c t  c o n d i t i o n I've always had one of these on my phone. Had to get a new phone while on vacation and the service at my rental was terrible!!! Slapped one of these on and, I don't know if it's the power of suggestion, but my new phone works soooo much better!!!! Love these things! Recommend!!! It gives my cell phone a little more boost and works very good.  I will recommend this product to family and friends. Very well , no problem at all is good for activities like exercising.  Fits ok I don't think is too long unless you are a girl with tiny wrist using this from over a month now. best watch band ever i bought Love the wrist band. Very comfortable. Looks good. I've received several compliments on this. Excellent fit and feel. If yours looking for a band alternative that isn't metal then this is for you. Flows well with the moto 360 gen 2. I am a nurse and I wash my hands multiple times during a shift and so far it has held together well. I bought this and stuck a large piece of Velcro to the otter Box and the other side of the Velcro to a stand-up paddleboard.  It does not hold a lot of stuff, but you can fit a phone and some cash and credit cards. perfect for what i wanted. great seal, no defects, great product. and a good price too, not one bad thing to say about this. do your research, decide on a size and color, and rest. Otterbox and Pelican make good stuff. very durable, water tight, use this in my backpack to keep medical supplies dry, the clamps hold tight with a solid click when shut Great otterbox dry box, I got the clear version as recommended by other reviews and like it. After reading the size dementions between this (3000) and the 2000 I went with this one, I wanted to keep my ipod 4g with otterbox defender safe inside and eventually an iphone with either a defender or armor case. So i compared the sizes and ended up with this 1. First, at least the clear version of this box is way bigger then u would expect, it dwarfs my little ipod in there, but leaves plenty of room for wallet/anything else. It is much to big for a pocket or anything like that, but would easily fit in a backpack and comfortibly fits in your hand when u carry it.  In conclusion, if u want the extra space, get this 1, if not and you want just your phone/other small items, get the 2000. Note: (will fit an iphone 3-4-5  with pretty much any case on it and still have plenty of room for wallet/anything else) <div id=\"video-block-R1HG2HP0Y185FC\" class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block\"></div><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/E1mgkSKo0rS.mp4\" class=\"video-url\"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ljo5kJfhS.png\" class=\"video-slate-img-url\">&nbsp;Great little box.

      "No place for D-ring to attach. I got this otterbox to hold my valuables at the pool this summer.  It is the perfect size for what I need and it is completely waterproof and crush proof.  I put some paper inside of it and held it under water and it was dry as a bone.  Then I had my 100 pound son stand on it and then me at nearly 200 pounds and it did not crack. Fits my phone and keys no problem, floats, and doesn't leak...great for fishing or canoe trips, a bit bulky, but gets the job done... I bought this for my son and this is what he has to say: \"This is a great case and held my phone waterproof on a whole cold weekend trip. My whole pack got wet and this case kept my phone dry. I would recommend this to anyone who needs  tough waterproof case.\" I needed a few small cases to store various items - radios, batteries, and such. I found both these and the Pelican Micro cases. While Pelican is the gold standard for the larger cases, only the OtterBox cases have the quality I expected in this size. The plastic seems to be more resistant to scratching and cracking, the bottom and top of the case actually 'seal' together, and the top and bottom are both padded to protect the contents from shock, whereas the pelican case only has rubber padding on the bottom half. The hinge opens to slightly over 180 degrees, but it is loose, so where you can open the Pelican lid half way and it will stay, the lid on this case will fall to either full open or full closed. The latches are a little tighter than the pelican case, especially to open, which is a good thing. The protrusions on the top and bottom do not stack. The lanyard, while it hasn't broken yet, seems like the first part that will fail. All in all, this seems to be a rugged storage and organizational tool. GNARLY BOX. ENOUGH ROOM TO PUT 2 GALAXY S 2 PHONES, A FEW CARDS AND SOME SMOKES IN WHEN GOING NEAR WATER. SORT OF WISH I BOUGHT THE DEEPER ONE, BUT THIS IS COOL FOR LIGHT APPLICATIONS. TESTED IT MYSELF, DEF. IS WATER PROOF AND EVEN FLOATS. SWEET DEAL. WOW, this is a great box for my iphone 4! I ordered it this past May - knowing that w/ 3 kids & all their friends, my phone would need protection from the summer pools, water sprinklers, garden hoses & water balloon fights! Not to mention bathing the 3 dogs. Well, it paid for itself more than once, when the kids or myself knocked it accidentally into a pool! I initially panicked both times, but my phone was bone dry, and the case popped right back up to the surface & bobbed till I could reach it! VERY HAPPY with this box. HIGHLY recommend! NO reservations :-) Well made, well priced, works EXCELLENTLY! What more can one say? Fabulous!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have an iphone, you need an otterbox DEFENDER case (to protect against drops or crushing) and this waterproof otterbox - both under $20 each on amazon! Small price to pay to protect ones iphone investment! Would also recommend a capitative stylus, particularly the ones that secure into the earbud jack. VERY handy! ..and I'm from Europe, where the phones and networks are much better than in the States. I have to say that I think Samsung currently have the best software (and I used to be a huge Nokia fan). Amazingly light, very intuitive, great audio, and just looks great. I recommend this without any reservations whatsoever. I received my Treo 600 last Friday from Treocentral, with service from Sprint. I have been testing it and comparing the Sprint coverage against AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and Nextel.\n",
      "I have found that even when I had only 1 signal bar, the calls still went through. While Nextel's coverage was as good, they don't have a pdaPhone that can compare to the Treo 600.\n",
      "The only thing lacking on the Treo 600 is the ability to use grafitti, which I have become very used to on my Palm i705.\n",
      "I am cancelling my AT&T account, as well as my Palm.net account (no longer need that since the Treo 600 replaces my Palm i705) and going with the Treo 600 for both wireless phone and Palm Pilot features.\n",

What's sorely lacking with the Blackberry is a decent web browser (yes I know there are some available and those with BES or 7510 can use reqwireless).\n",
      "\n",
      "The Blackberry also has a major flaw in the lack of applications written for the device. It is primarily a one trick pony - that does that trick exceptionally well.

      "There is rumored to be another more advanced model coming late 2004. The Treo is Fantastic.  I've had mine for about ten days, and couldn't be happier.  The call quality is as good if not better than verizon (here in SF bay area) with fewer dropped calls.  The speaker volume is also really loud.  The screen is amazingly bright, much better than my Sony NX70.  Although resolution isn't hi-res, the quality is still surprisingly good, for pictures and video.  Email and web access is very fast on the sprint network, and the PDA seems very stable.  With the rebates, it's an awesome value.  Now that I have all my contacts accessible, I keep in touch with people more.  Get it. I have had 5 cell phones in the past 10 years, starting with the original MOTOROLA FLIP-PHONE.  Then I moved over to a NOKIA phone, which was okay, but I was not satisfied.  I moved over to the NEXTEL phone service for my next phone, which was the MOTOROLA i1000 and a couple of years later I bought the i90, which was the phone I have been using until I recently upgraded to the i730.  I have been with NEXTEL for the last 5 years and I am completely satisfied with their professionalism and outstanding service.  The trade-in/buy-back program is wonderful and it definitely the best way to upgrade your phone.  NOW........on to the i730.......WOW..........what an awesome phone!!!!!!!!!  I can't begin to tell you that NEXTEL offers the best MOTOROLA phones then any other carrier.  I have looked at other phones from other carriers and none compare to the i730.  If this is your 1st MOTOROLA phone purchase, you are in for a real treat.  The instructions are well-documented and it doesn't take rocket-science to navigate through the i730 software.  The biggest treat for me is the COLOR screen, the sleek-ness of the phone and it's overall aesthetic beauty.  So if want to be the envy of all your friends, please do yourself a favor and pick up this phone.  Also, once you experience the NEXTEL service, it will definitely be your last and only phone carrier.  PROOF:  I have successfully moved over many friends and family members to NEXTEL and I haven't heard any compliants.  ENJOY! Other than the high initial cost (I got it before they put in a promotion, duh), i really love this compact and stylish phone.  It's the best Nextel has offered yet, although there's rumor that a camera phone is coming out soon.  If you can wait, wait a bit longer, otherwise for walkie-talkie style cellular, Nextel is the best.  No delays like with Verizon (up to 30 seconds!) or Sprint (10 secs).  Walkie-talkie that actually works where there's coverage.  I'm a happy customer. If you need to be geographically challenged and learn, this is the one. I travel a lot, and decided it was finally time to start recording where I have been. I didn't realize that maps were insanely expensive! I found this map, read some good (and bad) reviews, but decided to purchase it anyway.\n",

      "This map is exactly what I needed. It came rolled up and in a box that was meant for shipping maps (or large pictures). It came in perfect condition, AND it came on time. It is the perfect size (and its visually pleasing), and it has the countries, states, and cities all laid out and printed. Even the cities that are not printed, you can get a rough estimate as to where they are because the map is actually accurate! I was able to locate everywhere that I have been to, and pinned them all to my wall. I am very pleased with this map. Hopefully they start making bigger ones so I can make a big travel map for the family to put in the basement! Is a great map very detailed and easy to read some of the countries listed have there names written in the language they speak. For example in Italy they put Rome as Roma so make sure you will be able to understand it. Also this product is well packaged compared to other maps. I love this product and would highly recommend it. I live about 100 miles from where this was shipped, just LOVE it...thought it would be here faster than it was....but...ships in a tube...so came damage free...cool map and pretty funny letter that they send with it...made me laugh...highly recommended .......kinda nice u know ...do yourself a favor and check them out....their more than just maps..... Its more than I expected, looks nice. I set this up in my home office and looks great. I recommend it. Well, just as pictured, I received the entire world.  Needed it to do a project which worked out well.  The paper it's on is a good thickness.  Every country is included as far as I can tell...what else is there to say?  It's a map!! go what I asked for in a timely manner. I ordered this and this is exactly what I got! perfect Always good to keep up in the bedroom so you can't get lost. \"There is no fear where love exists. Rather, perfect love banishes fear, for fear involves punishment, and the person who lives in fear has not been perfected in love.\" 1 John 4:18 bought this map for my office--to mark the places i visited with pins.  i framed the map and used a foam backboard to hold the pins. the frame and backboard were pretty inexpensive and didn't take very long to assemble. the only downside is that the names of the cities are pretty small--and depending what types of pins you use--the pin may cover up the city.\n",

      "i have no complaints.  glad i bought map. i love this poster! its soo big! it shows not only the US, but all the countries! even the pacific and Atlantic ocean! i am very pleased I was pleasantly surpised with the quality of this map.  The price was 1 cent so I was a little skeptical but once I opened it and rolled it out I was quite happy. This thing has so many charge terminals on it!

      "\n",
      "Also, this thing is built so ruggedly, that I don't think I could break it if I tried! Well, at least not from a simple drop this time. Highly recommended!

You simply plug it in, stick the batteries into it no matter what their current charge level is, and it refreshes it neatly and cleanly.\n",

      "BEST CHARGER EVER! Mounted the 60c on my motorcycle using this item.  Works well.  Seems very stable though I wrap the wrist band around the mirror for extra safety. Fits all of the handlebar sizes I have tried it on, holds the GPS unit securely, has not broken yet :). This mount works great. I've ridden over railroad tracks and other rough terrain and my Garmin 60csx stays solidly in place. I do have the lanyard pulled over the handle bar just in case, but the GPS has never come loose. When it snaps in place it is held tightly. I don't understand why others are having to use rubber bands or anything else. I ride a lot and never a problem. ... but after several thousand miles and almost as many pot-holes my 60csx is still firmly attached to the handlebars of my Harley.  I've been tying the wrist strap to the mirror \"just in case\" but it's been over the worst terrain Colorado, Wyoming and South Dakota have to offer without ever popping loose. I have been using this bracket to hold my 60Cx to my handlebars and I have been extremely happy with the purchase.  I use my bike as my primary source of transportation and it has been easy to get around thanks to the street maps that I loaded onto the GPS.  As other reviewers have noted, you definitely want to also tie the GPS to your handlebars.  I use the wrist strap that came with the GPS.  My bike fell over one day and the GPS popped right out of the bracket and was left dangling above the ground.  If it had not been tied, it easily would have impacted the ground. VERY  SATISFIED.\n",

The best ones out there and i have purchased many of these things and no others can top it Works very nice. keeps the phone in place. Works wonderfully at holding my laptop in place so that is doesn't slide off of my little padded laptop table. I was constantly readjusting it and pushing it back into place as I did homework on my couch. I've had it for about 6 months now and it still works as good as the 1st day, and i haven't even cleaned it once! Great product perfect. Used in conjunction with a 15\" cargo net to mount a Gamecube on the center arm rest box thing in my 98 Accord.  For this cause, it works perfectly.  Provides an apparently ridiculous amount of friction as the Gamecube has no sliding play in it at all.  Size is also perfect.  It's less than an inch wider than a Gamecube and whatever length longer.  Sufficient at any rate.  The only problem I have now is that I sometimes elbow the Gamecube's carry handle when I shift into second and, because this product works so well, it kinda hurts! I bought this item for my car it has alot of storage it is sticky it even holds my portable cd player yup i still have one Works as advertised this is the best Sticky pad I have had.\n",

They do get dirty and need to be cleaned, but they hold the laptops and phones that I put on them. This one is the best out of all the other sticky pads, if you want the large one. Holds very good Cleans easy and never looses stickyness. Good in all weather conditions! Big! Its a decent size. More than decent. Works as expected. Holds my galaxy note in place just fine. Plenty of space for exta things and I found it to be a great product still. Sold my vehicle that I had it in and regretted not taking it out. But found it here and purchased it for myself and my boyfriends truck. I love this larger size for the truck dash. I used to have one of the smaller/regular sized ones ages ago and really have no clue where it went after getting a different car. I have some of those LG Tone+ 730 Bluetooth headphones that I use daily but wanted somewhere in my car to put them when not wearing them around my neck. I thought of this and was happy to see they now have this oversized version. My headset fits perfectly on it and doesn't budge when I'm trying around. You could easily fit 2 large screen smartphones or a tablet on one of these as well. never slip item on this pad. and washable and clean. Better so nice. I strong recommened this item so much. I do prefer the other xl sticky pad they make but this works as well. Just rinse off with water & dry to make stickier Nice and big. I use it to set a \"take out\" container of dinner on my dashboard when I have to eat on the job. It's doing the job just fine. My food hasn't spilled yet! This was a great price and was exacltly as described.  The larger size was a good fit for the middle console flip top storage of my truck. After buying a few of the cheap pads and being disappointed with them, I bought this. It is worth the money. It goes much longer between having to wipe it down. But yes, like any of these pads, you DO have to wipe them down because eventually dust will cling to the surface and you won't be sticking your device to the pad; you'll be sticking it to a layer of dust.\n",
      "\n",
      "To wipe it down, I use pre-moistened glasses wipes with alcohol. After a quick wipe, it's as sticky as day one. Also, I bought this \"super size\" version and cut it down into smaller pieces and had no problems doing so. Now I have 3 pads for the price of 1 big one. Handstands Super Size Sticky Pad - Black  holds very well, I've yet to have anything slip off it yet.\n",
      "Using this pad to me is like using Super Glue with a release when needed. This works great for me.  It even held a small thermometer at about a vertical 45 degree angle on dash so that I could read it.  It is very sticky on both sides.  Its so sticky that you have to careful about removing things like my cell phone or it will pull off the dashboard and stick to itself requiring time to unstick it and replace the pad.  I don't think the edges will curl up as I have read on some other reviews. I have purchased more than a dozen sticky pads over the years and i like this one the best because it has a larger surface area of almost 7\" x 9\" compared to the typical 4\" x 6\" size. And this pad's stickiness is just right, where as other sticky pads you will have to use force peel your cellphone off the stick mat and the cellphone paint and then you need to re-apply the phone's screen protector touch up the cellphone's lost paint. I recommend this product and have bought a 2nd one! I was very pleased with this product.  It works as advertised and holds my iPhone on my center console without slipping at all.  It also sticks to the center console very well.  I would highly recommend this product. Cingular 2 Year Contract I purchased this item a while back, but I remember that it was great item.  I would definitely recommend it. Good customer service. never any issues. great about upgrades. Simple and Easy to get and new phone mailed and have simple instructions on how to setup your new phone. This was a lovely purchase the gift went over very well The item is still being used Love it Thank you Thus far, I haven't had any problems.  Everything went smoothly, I could have ported number if I wanted (After puchasing) I got two numbers 1 digit a part all in my area code.  Everything went well, would recomend.\n",

Simple and Easy to get and new phone mailed and have simple instructions on how to setup your new phone. it's all good I had to do this do not know why as I do not even remember what this was I was going to buy a new PlayStation 3 and a few games when I stumbled across this offer for Regulatory Fee! I really couldn't resist and in fact next to being torn with the temptation of ordering a Rolex, ordering the PS3 or pulling the trigger on this one, I found an uncontrollable urge and my mouse going crazy to do a left click.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now I have a new Blackberry Bold that I love and a Regulatory Fee that I hope I don't see again until this phone dies in about 2 years. out of all the regulatory fees i've ever paid, this was HANDS DOWN the BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  i absolutely loved every minute of the joy that it brought to me and my family!!!  five out of FIVE STARS!!! Before I got this one, I couldn't imagine paying $2.50 for a Regulatory Cost Recovery Fee.  Now I can't imagine living without it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the other reviewers don't seem to understand what they bought.  They ordered a wireless plan on Amazon and didn't realize that it came with a Regulatory Cost Recovery Fee.  Then they were asked to write a review before they even realized what they got.\n",
      "\n",
      "But a little experience shows that this Regulatory Cost Recovery Fee is a marvel of innovation that is packed with value!\n",
      "\n",
      "Think about it.  There was a time when phone companies were much more heavily regulated.  Then congress passed lots of new laws to change phone company regulation and allow more competition.  These laws are extremely complicated, and the congressmen needed help writing them.  So, the phone companies came to the rescue with teams of lobbyists to help write the new laws!\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem was that those lobbyists were extremely expensive. To make matters worse, the phone companies knew that if they didn't get everything they wanted, they'd have to hire even more expensive lawyers to fight the laws.  So in exchange for agreeing to deregulation, they invented the beautifully-named Regulatory Cost Recovery Fee.  Hurray!\n",
      "\n",
      "This wonderful invention allows the phone companies to charge an extra fee over-and-above the rates that they are allowed to charge for their services, so that they can fund the very expensive effort of fighting the other parts of the laws that they don't like!  They can make the fee any amount they want, because it doesn't actually go to any government or regulatory body.  It just goes straight to the phone company so they can hire more lawyers.  With high-powered Washington lawyer/lobbyists charging $400 an hour, you can imagine how hard it would be to survive without these great fees!\n",
      "\n",
      "What's even more brilliant is the name.  \"Regulatory Cost Recovery Fee\" is one of the greatest product names ever.  It just screams out \"I'm official.\"  It sounds so much like a tax, people actually believe that it is one, and it sounds so official, nobody questions the exact amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, this is one brilliant product that's packed with value. The last PCS cell phone I owned was the venerable SCP-8100 from Sanyo.  It was a cute little phone that was the second cell phone from any U.S. carrier that could take pictures.  (The first-ever model was the SCP-5300 also from Sanyo, released in July 2002.)  The PM-8200 addressed two shortcoming of the 8100: 1) camera quality, and 2) speakerphone.\n",
      "The 8200 sports a higher-resolution built-in camera.  Picture quality is also improved.  The old 8100's pictures often had streaks and distorted colors.  The 8200's pictures look much better.  The speakerphone is definitely a great addition for those of us who like to multi-task yet dislike headsets.  The volume and clarity could be a little better, but given the compact size of this phone, it's not bad.\n",
      "Reception on the 8200 is great, thanks to its external antenna.  Battery life is good, unless you save a lot of things in memory, which depletes battery faster the more stuff it holds.  The phone is attractive and can be customized in many ways, not to mention it comes in three colors.  To Sanyo, I suggest you use the iPod Mini color scheme, because not many people like big red!\n",
      "In summary, the 8200 delivers lots of improvements over the already-excellent 8100.  If you have Sprint or plan to get Sprint, this is the phone.  If you want video recording, check out the Toshiba phone for Sprint. Before buying this headset, I tried on practically every other headset on the market.  None of them would stay on my ear.  I have a small head and small ears, and I wanted something low profile that would stay on while I was walking.  This headset is nice and snug and works great.  I highly recommend it to anyone who has trouble finding headsets that fit. I received this little gem for Christmas and now I refuse to speak into the phone itself.  This BT enabled unit is the perfect gift for anyone with a cell phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "No more complicated setups.  As soon as I turned this on, my Nokia found it, recognized it, associated it, and I was speaking into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The battery life is great and the clarity is also dead on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you use this product, you too will never go back to speaking into your phone the old fashioned way. Item fit perfectly.  I have an older Chevrolet pickup and wanted to replace the front speakers.  This connector worked perfectly with no wire splicing.  Had the new speakers installed in minutes. Worked great in my 1991 GMC Sonoma.\n",
      "\n",
      "Watch out what style plug you have, some crossover between years and models it seems.  These are the right ones for S10/S15 trucks but can't say the same for all 1991 GM products. Perfect fit. The Amazon car checker shows two different ones that fit. Of coarse i bought the wrong one first. Metra 72-4568 does not fit. The correct one is 72-4500 for the door speakers. Maybe the other one fits the rear quarter panel speakers. I don't know why they would be different. I am guessing that the Metra 72-4568 is for the rear 6 x 9 rear speakers. FYI. 1995 Blazer 2 door with factory 6 speakers. Worked beautifully on my daughters 1986 Cadillac Seville, and at a Bargain price.  Couldn't ask for more.\n",
      "Shipping was fast - nothing else to say. I love this headset!  Not only it is light and comfortable to wear, but it's also stylish.  The volume level is fantatic and the sound is very clear.  I had tried Jabra BT250 and it was so staticky that I had to return it.  I live and work in NYC, and you can hear the voice clearly even with noisy background.  I highly recommend this product - BTW, my phone is Sony Ericsson T637. This is a great model of bluetooth headset, and you can't beat the price.  This model is especially easy to use with the \"open the boom\" feature to automatically connect to your phone.  This price is $30 cheaper than most wholesalers can get it for! This is a great case for my daughters oboe. We had one for 4 years and the bag looks like new but the zippers were shot so bought another. It has a great front pocket that holds all of her sheet music and extra reeds. Well put-together with what seems to be high-quality materials.  It's just the right size for what I needed, a carryall I can take on international travels that stays attached (to me).\n",
      "I had used a smaller, but similarly-designed pack for decades, but now I have a new camera (Sony alpha 6000) with a monster lens (18-200) which won't fit into my old case, forcing me to buy this new one.\n",
      "The fit is perfect, leaving a bit of room for a thin windbreaker (and or sandwich) in the main compartment, and both my wallet and a small backup point & shoot camera in the front compartment.\n",
      "Batteries, digital cards, earphone jacks, etc in the side pockets.\n",
      "The cellphone holder uses a velcro-secured flap, and seems to have been designed for a large or medium flip phone.  My normal-sized Droid phone fits just fine, but it might not be compatible with some of the larger (wider or longer) smartphones like a Samsung or larger iPhone (though I haven't tried it).\n",
      "My only gripe is that I'm not overly fond of the dark brown color.  Would probably have preferred the light brown, but it's not worth the hassle of exchanging. Great quality with plenty of room. I use it for everyday use. It holds my wallet in the front compartment and the large compartment holds my camcorder just fine. The side pocket holds extra sd cards and there is another Velcro side pocket that holds a extra battery for the camcorder. Plus the large compartment can also hold a small battery charger and mini gorilla tripod along with the camcorder. I couldn't find any camcorder bags this compact that does that for the price. Also bought one for a friend. This cell phone/fanny pack is so roomy, you can put anything in the bag, such as mp3 player or a large sized wallet. I like this bag and I will buy this again. Want to power an accessory on you boat up front or have an extra cigarette lighter plug in on the console.  Nice well built lighter socket. I'm a ham radio operator. In constructing a portable station that is 12 volt battery powered, I added two of these to the power panel on the front of the rack that holds my equipment. One is used at night with an LED map light on a gooseneck and the other is available for charging phones or running other 12 volt equipment that is powered through a cigarette lighter plug.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are rugged and easy to mount in a 1 1/8\" hole. Connection is via standard quick-connects. No soldering required. I fused each of these behind the panel with 10 Amp in-line automotive fuses. Great product. Does what it is supposed to. I rigged a few of these around my 12ft Jon Boat so that I could have power front to back. These worked like a charm. I additionally bought some male lighter plugs which I soldered onto a few electronics such as lights and trolling motor. Great buy and definitely recommend! These have got to be the best in dash cigarette sockets made. I've purchased 4 of the for different projects. If you don't like the  2 screw face plate it can be removed and use it without This works perfectly for my application. This is one part of 5 items I used to connect my second 12VDC battery to a  new item on my boat. heavy duty, good connections This is a great little power port.  It mounts easily with a locking nut on the rear, then all you have to do is run your power lines to it.  I've installed about 5 of these in various automotive applications and they are all functioning fine, many with years of use (one is almost 10 years old and still working just fine.)  The attached dust cap is a nice touch. good quality I have bought units like this in the past under the Marinco brand.  This seems every bit as good at half the price.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem I have had with the Marinco is that the snap on cover tends to pop loose when it is supposed to stay closed.  This unit seems to have a firmer grip on the hold and looks like it will stay in place.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought this for my golf cart.  We'll see how it holds up over time. Quality and sturdy. Installed with no issues. Make sure you get the polarity right, or you will toast your chargers (lesson learned). Based upon the packaging, it's might be some quality old inventory which was purchased for resale. Either way, it's a quality product, not a cheesy piece of junk. The price is right also. Works great!  Installed them as additional receptacles in our RV The cigarette lighter stopped working in my Toyota pickup. I've had the console apart before to install a car stereo and did not feel like doing again to install a new cigarette lighter socket. I removed the lower console piece by removing two screws and  the ash tray. I used a hole saw to cut out an opening in the lower console and installed the cigarette lighter socket. I used the existing wires to connect the power and ground. I could of also ran a power wire to the battery. super Great I got to be honest here, I haven't hooked it up yet but I tested it for plug size and it fits well  The quality is also much better than expected, I have a feeling it will last for many years in an outdoor application.  good for power out as well as on-board battery charging.\n",
      "\n",
      "Put one on your motor cycle, boat, and plane.  (if thy are 12volt) nice and easy to install Good product. Would order again. Works perfect on my boat- I purchased this to mount in the back of my 4x4 to plug my refrigerator/freezer in for long off road trips, it works great and my refrigerator staid powered the whole time without any issues going over lots of bumps. Worked great for my 4wheeler addition through the storage uniton the front. PERFECT Great product Awesome price Arrived on time as described. Fit well. Would buy again Works good and easy to put in Used this to add a dash cam in my Ford. The terminals on this fit a female spade connector perfectly which made installation a flash. fits in perfectly Works like a charm, solid, robust, heavy duty. No issues with 100+ watts of draw. Highly recommend! very good ,great  stuff! Works Great! Have used these before. The cycle place wants 40.00 per socket put $100.00 to drill a hole to mount it. And it is the same item. easy to install and does what I need it to do - like plug in the TV as described. Thanks! I added this to my tractor for a powered 3pont sprayer. ok very heavy duty Excelent!!!! great Works. Water tight. Shipped quick. Thanks Good price fast shipping and easy to install. I bought to install in a battery box on our travel trailer for the LED light on my RV flag pole. Appears to be good and water proof, we'll see! 3 years later and this device is still working perfectly on a dual sport motorcycle that has been ridden in driving rain, gone up the sides of mountains, covered in mud and dust.  Still charges my phone on every ride. I installed this on my FJR1300 about 2 years ago and it has worked without issue.  The cap is soft plastic or rubber and seals the plug effectively in the rain. The socket can be removed from the mounting plate and installed in a round hole, which is how I mounted it.  This would work equally well on a boat, RV or motorcycle.  Typical Amazon good pricing and fast delivery. good for used .I already have one and had to get another one for a different Perfect for adding a 12V socket inside the console of my 2007 4Runner.

Seems strong\n",
      "And water resistant when close. Fit for its purpose.  Easy access to the connectors on the back Got this to install in the glove box on my Kawasaki Concours.  Simple to install, unobtrusive and doesn't take up hardly any room, works great. and you can't beat the price. excellent article\n",

      "I am satisfied with the quality mu and the timely delivery Bought this for my golf cart and it looks nice installed and works well for many items I sometimes plug in while in my cart... this was a great addition to the boat especially if you have those electronics that you charge. Easy to install. I am using this connector as charger for my portable stereo.  I Was able to charge phones while camping so it works great. Wonderful product.  made to withstand the elements and the rigors of my tractor or  your boat.  Very pleased with the product and its capability to work in the ellements. I got my v600 over a month ago. I use it with my T-mobile service in Hungary. At first I was somewhat disappointed with my phone because I could not get some of the internet functions to work. However, after some discussion with T-mobile customer service and a visit to the T-mobile office, I discovered that T-mobile had not properly prepared my phone...not Motorola's fault!\n",
      "\n",
      "My V600's performance has been outstanding. Extremely long standby and talk times. The bluetooth connection works very well. I use mine with a Jabra BT250.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is my third generation Motorola. After years of Nokia phones, I received a Motorola Timeport as a gift (terrible phone with lousy menus). The next year I won a v66 in a raffle. I was pleasantly surprised with the v66, especially it small size. Motorla had significantly improved the menu from the Timeport, but it still wasn't the best. The V600's menu has improved on the V66.\n",
      "\n",
      "The V600's color screen is wonderfully clear and the pre-loaded ringtones are very nice. I don't really use the camera feature, but the few times that I fooled around with it found that it took decent pictures. Finally, I was concerned about the V600's size until I actually had it in my hand. While it is a little bit bigger than the V66, it is not much bulkier. I still wear it around my neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I can highly recommend the V600 for its numerous features and nice styling. The new V600 from Motorola finally arrived. It has all the functions of a typical power cell phone these days: built-in digital camera, color screens, and lots of bells & whistles. But I have to say its styling is more attractive than most of the plain-vanilla silver phones from Asian manufacturers. Also, it's solidly built and feels sturdy. Reception is great, although I'm still not thrilled with T-Mobile's coverage here in the Northeast.\n",
      "\n",
      "What really excites me about the phone is the inclusion of Bluetooth and its quad-band capability. The latter means it'll get more coverage in the future as the new frequency is being implemented here in the U.S. (Does't make a difference overseas.) Bluetooth means I can finally use a wireless headset, and also hook up to my PDA and Fujitsu laptop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though this is available only for T-Mobile, it's one of the very best phones on the market today. 1 year update - I use these way more than I ever thought I would. I sweat in them on long runs, I wear them driving to talk (one ear only, obviously), and I wear them around the house listening to podcasts. They have never failed to pair, they have never sounded bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only dislike is that they bounce around if you run with them. In winter (now) I tuck them under my jacket, but in summer they bounce and are annoying, but still usable. In summer I use 2 large safety pins to secure the ends to my shirt to keep them from moving around on my neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "And once I had to clear the memory (read how online at moto website).this was when I'd upgraded to a new phone and had too many devices paired, I think.\n",
      "\n",
      "1 month Update: I've been asked how they hold up with sweat (see below). No problem working up a sweat on the treadmill, but I must stress that I've not put in a summer run. I also must say that I do not expect longevity from a non-sweatoroof product, and that the s11 headphones are designed with a sweatproof nano coating. HOWEVER, since you asked, they still sound and work excellent. They bounce around running, but it's not intolerable... Just not ideal. BATTERY: I've used them every day since I got them, and often times days at the house studying all day and going to the gym. They last from morning to night constantly connected. I often forget I'm wearing them when I turn on my music and don't hear any sound from my phone/tablet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: just for the record, the Motorola site says these are NOT for working out (under questions about product, it says not sweatproof and should be kept away from moisture). I'm going to work out in them anyway and I'll report back when they fail.\n",

      "I bought the jaybird bluebuds x for my girlfriend, and I've used them several times, so that is my comparison point.\n",
      "\n",
      "These headphones have a very utilitarian, price conscious design. They don't sound as awesome as the $180 bluebuds, and they aren't as sleek as them (bluebuds are just a cord with tiny ear pieces). BUT, they are very easy to control, very light, and sound very good. I'm not taking away anything by saying they don't sound as good as the bluebuds... The bluebuds sound as good as Bose or klipsch wired models of similar cost (even MKBHD says they are amazing). The Motorola buds really sound great. I'd choose them based on sound over any of the cheaper wired sets I have (skull candy, JVC, etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The ear pieces, at first, I was worried about them. They didn't look like they would be very secure, but I was wrong. You can easily work out with them and they will stay in. And they swivel a bit at the ear pieces, so every time you move, you don't hear a bunch of thumping like many in-ear wired sets.\n",
      "\n",
      "And taking them out to hear the world around you is nice, because of the magnets. No flopping around.\n",
      "\n",
      "The built-in equalizer settings are nice, the controls are easy, and they stay around your neck when laying on your back.\n",
      "\n",
      "So you sacrifice some portability over the bluebuds, but you get a great ease of use, very good sound, and less than half the price.\n",
      "\n",
      "And truthfully, while they aren't super stylish... People are walking around with those giant beats studio headphones on. These look way less ridiculous than that, and really aren't that bad. Don't wear them to a job interview. I have had a pair for a couple years now and love them. Grammy was so unhappy with the ear buds she had I surprised her with her own pair and she loves them just as much. Now I can talk to her without having to ask her to repeat herself a hundred times. Works great! No issues. Great One of the best and longest lasting headsets I've used. One side doesn't work anymore but I assure you it's from my personal abuse of the device.  Wouldn't hesitate to purchase again. nice Arrived on time, packaged nice and neat.  Love the style and ease of use.  Haven't tried them out while riding my motorcycles, but so far I like what I see. fits an sounds very clear Great Love thus Me gustaron Great quality. I like these better than the LG or some of the cheaper versions I have tried. So far I find these comfortable and easy to use. The call quality seems to be perfect as I've had no complaints as I did with the other bluetooth headphones I've tried. Lasts a long time and ships quickly Got my Mom this Bluetooth and she loves!  Thanks! Lightweight and has longer range than the cheaper brands.  Really comfortable to wear and sleep with.  The earbuds are flat on the outside and therefore not bulky in the ear.  They earbuds really stick to the magnets very well at the tips of the unit.  I bought other cheaper brands and they don't have the range and would drop me.  I can go farther away with the Motorola Buds. Love them. Probably the best headset i've bought. There tips are little difficult  to use but you can switch it out for the typical ones on most  earbuds. The range and sound are good and they are sweat proof from what I can tell with my use. With 15 size neck this headset just fits comfortably. I can wear it to sleep on my left side , right side and flat. Wear it with dressing shirt no problem. Maybe too tight for big necks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice: I ordered the white one, it comes with headset, two extra ear pieces one micro USB charge cable. I don't find portch and wall charger shown in the picture for the black one. My second pair. First pair lasted 14 months of hard use. Probably got really wet and that caused them to fail. Excellent product and price. After using these can't imagine ever going back to wired headphones again. Also great for answering calls. Only minor complaint would be the volume could go louder but it's just about perfect. This is a wonderfull product.  It is easy to use and its sound is beyond  my expectations. It is worth its price. ok. i do really love these. i switched to these after my lg tones infinums broke. i can say that it is really hard to tell the difference in audio quality both in music and in talk. about the only \"complaint\" i have is that they are stiff. the collar has no give at all. it is just there. (for some this might not be a problem. for me i have a thicker neck so i do notice a little.\n",
      "now the magnets on these are really strong. i mean they can support there own weight form one ear bud so its really easy to get them back to a home position when not in use.\n",
      "for the price, and you need to go much higher, (for this style of bluetooth headset) you cant beat them. These are really good ear buds. Signal is strong and good for more than 3 feet (unlike some others I have had). For the price, these are the best available. however, do know that you will replace them at least once per year. This is my 3rd one I think. I love them, but expect them to just stop working at some point. Very good quality and easy to wear...you forget you are even wearing them! Without a doubt the best wireless Bluetooth headset out there in regards to a good mix of sound and functionality. I personally like these headphones for their sound, function and value, though they are not sweat proof (my QY8 are so far.)  I want to try Motorola's newer model soon as they do appear more stylish. I've enjoyed these for well over a year with frequent use, including working out but mostly just around.  They are very convenient for switching between music, phone, or nothing (i.e., life).  The sound is good.  The controls are convenient and take only a little getting used to, as is the case for all such headsets.  My pet peeve is at start-up, when a voice that is way too loud and distorted states that the \"device\" is on and...paired.  It is especially bizarre because these otherwise never distort either voice or music. Fix: I simply keep the buds out of my ear until that awful announcement is over, then plug in.\n",

      "Unfortunately, my buds just broke (volume in one ear dropped).  I looked around for alternatives but nothing looks that great (I have used similar Moto and LG earbud headsets).  And at this price, I am happy to buy again. Sounds great, 100 reception from phone and cheap I actually bought three of us this year for family and friends and I have one for myself so I guess that's 4. These are great your buds for the price fantastic I used these every single day at my desk, and the charge generally lasts the full work day.  Comfortable, functional and now I can't live without them.  I do think that the microphone is a bit sensitive to movement on your shirt or collar which can create a loud sound for your caller on the other end (so I try to remain still while on a call) but the stereo sound is good and the Bluetooth connection has never dropped from my phone once.  I like the ability to answer calls, skip tracks and control volume from the device.  They are light, and more than once I've left the house forgetting I'm wearing them.  Love these at work and while walking for exercise.  Cannot comment on their water resistance, as I don't use in the rain or sweat profusely while exercising -- but for my daily needs, these are great for taking tunes and talk radio wherever I go (housework, workplace, shopping at the store to relieve boredom, etc).  Had them for over a year and battery still going strong. Maybe a bit unconfortable for some but it works nice and the quality is better than expected. These are great and worth the price. I use them just walking around the house and haven't used them while working out yet. I'm hoping they hold up for a while. Nice sound, comfortable in ears.  Light around the neck.  Works well with smartphone. Great for the price. Good battery life. Satisfactory and arrived promptly. Excellent sound for the price. Much higher volume than similar SoundPeats headset. Bought SoundPeats headset and Cosmos travel case. The Motorola Buds are longer and too large for Cosmos case. Anybody with Buds found a travel case that they will fit in???? Wasn't sure what to expect from these. They're the first pair of BT headphones I've purchased that have the battery resting on my neck. But, man, these are terrific! They last for 2-3hrs of actual playback and the neck piece is actually so light that you forget it is there. The small strings on the earbuds allow my head to turn easily without any pulling whatsoever. Very quick charging time, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saw the \"beefier\" versions in the local cellular stores, but at a much higher price. Figured I'd stick my toe in with the low-cost model and am not disappointed. I'll buy the better model if these ever wear out - I know I'll be getting my money's worth. I quite like these. After trying a number of cheaply made Chinese Bluetooth headphones, all of which failed within a month or two, I tried a name brand. Go figure, they work well and thus far haven't failed me. They sound fine. The buds fit in my ear. The charge lasts around 8 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, they work as they should, and they haven't died as quickly as the horrible Chinese junk.  Look elsewhere (at audiophile prices) if you crave audiophile headphones.  These are workman headphones.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one thing to consider is whether they will fit on your neck. They are made of a rigid plastic, so that if you have a large neck, they won't fit at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ever that I was not paid to provide a rave review with cash, prizes, or merchandise. I bought these with my own money for my personal use.  The fake reviews that permeate the ethically challenged people who post electronic junk reviews is making it difficult to trust any reviews posted on Amazon, which does mean that the rest of us need to post honest reviews. Picked these up refurb'd on another site for 20 bucks.  Having owned both the Motorola S9 and S10, I wasn't expecting much.  The S10 was a downgrade in sound quality from the older S9's (which had WOW EQ...the S10s had no EQ settings at all), so why would these be any better?  Man was I wrong.  I would imagine much of this is owed to the aptX codec that is supported by my Note 4 and the fact that they have brought back built-in EQ settings.  With my S10s I needed to use a phone EQ to make them sound even mediocre.  Not these.  I turned my EQ off and use the built-in and they sound amazing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another huge thing that has been upgraded is comfort.  Due to the odd shape and size of the earbuds on the S9s and S10s, if you wore them for more than an hour or so they became extremely uncomfortable.  These have moved to a more traditional earbud format, not to mention you don't look like the guy from Star Wars with some stupid blinking band wrapped around the back of your head, its a simple band looped around your neck with ample cord length for the buds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, much improved over Moto's previous efforts, and a fantastic bargain, even at the full retail price, considering I paid over $50 for both my S9s and S10s.  Good on you Motorola!  Great product! Love it and great price too! So far 5 star's Wasn't sure if these would meet my goals but they come 90% to what I'd hoped for. They are comfortable to wear, the cords haven't caught on anything yet (like ipod buds will) and once I got the right size ends they sealed out the outside sound to a large degree and gave greater volume. I have old timers tinnitus and high freq hearing loss so cannot comment on fidelity but they are quite good for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "buds are small enough and fit well into my hear holes that I can get my motorcycle helmet on and off with these in place without disturbing them! They aren't overly loud but loud enough to allow me to hear pavement engine and some traffic noise with the music turned up. Controls are easy for non-throttle hand to find and use once I figured out which button does what. Paired with my iPhone 6 quickly, and the only lack is a 'back' button to replay a song if you would want or a skip forward and back a bit to rehear an audiobook passage.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've already recommended these to others so I guess I like them that well and at $35 they're a steal! Nice pair of Bluetooth headsets. My son loves them. Good quality. They sound great!  So comfortable I don't even know I'm wearing them!\n",
      "Wish they had separate 'forward/reverse' buttons instead of 'play/forward' buttons but these work great. Absolutely excellent!  Has made using my phone so much more pleasurable!  Easy to connect and battery lasts a long time!  Were delivered ahead of time in great packaging!  Would buy again! MY HUSBAND LOVE THIS BECAUSE IT IS JUST LIKE HIS FIRST ONE HE HAD. First of all, I just got these so I can't speak to the longevity.  I've been using a $12 set of buds for almost a year and have put up with the hassle of the wires just because they sound so flippin good.  With a frequency response of 10 to 20,000Hz, I got all the bass I wanted as well as mid to high range.  That said, I was leery about BT ear buds but I've always been a fan of Moto products even though I have a Samsung Avant phone so I decided to give them a try.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got the buds yesterday, charged them up and tried them out.  I placed them on my neck and they curved down and rested on my collar bone very comfortably.  I turned them on with the button which is located in the back; kind of awkward but not a deal breaker.  Pairing them with my Samsung  Avant phone was very quick and easy; the Avant recognized them immediately and all I had to do was confirm the pairing. The first thing I noticed was that the sound wasn't as rich or deep as I had hoped.  The buds felt like they wanted to pull out because the connecting wires seemed to stretch to their limits as I turned my head and I don't have a big neck and, even though I have been accused of having a big head, it is actually quite average.  I had read about this being an issue from another reviewer so I moved the adjustment bands all the way back to give me as much wire as possible and that helped but anything rubbing against them, like a shirt collar, might be a hindrance, plus, I was still bothered about the sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "I started playing with the buttons after reading the directions in the instruction manual and found they were reversed from my buds.  It showed the volume on the on the left side but when I pushed the left front button, I got the EQ.  Rotating through the EQ's didn't seem to make much difference.  The volume adjustment was actually on the right side and the call/play and track buttons are on the left side.  Once I got that figured out, I was ok.  Also, if you have a smart watch, you might not even have to worry about the controls.  I have a Moto360 and it also pairs to the phone at the same time as the buds so that just a plus for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back to the buds.  Because the buds come with the smallest ear pieces installed, I thought it might help to use the medium buds so I switched them for the small ones and they helped with the problem of them staying in my ears but didn't really improve the sound.  (By the way, they fit on the headset pretty snuggly so I don't think they will likely fall off and get lost.) While wearing them today, I found that the sound was okay with voices like comedy routines and wasn't too bad for normal music but I wanted more base.  I discovered that if I cupped my hands over my ears that I could hear the deeper base of the techno music I was listening to ... but I looked like an idiot so that wasn't a solution.  I was actually ready to send them back for a refund but when I got home I decided to try one more thing.  If I was covering the buds with my hands and they sounded better, maybe sound was \"leaking out\" so I tried the larger ear pieces.  In all honesty, that sounds like a stupid explanation but the bigger ear pieces do give me more base ... not nose bleed bass but adequate.  So, I listened to Southern rock to Techno to Classical and they all sound great to these aging ears so now I'll just have to see how the battery life is.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the Bluetooth, now that I have them paired, they hook up almost instantly.  I can't use them in the car because I have a BT transmitter for the stereo and they conflict with each other but other than that, I can roam around without dropping the BT on the earbuds.  By the way, I also noticed a difference in the EQ by switching ear pieces, albeit ever so slight.  One setting sounds like it has less bass, one with a little more and one with almost a slight bassy echo.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for me, the only cons (kind of) right now are:\n",
      "  - Power button is in the back behind your neck so are not real convenient.\n",
      "  - Status light is in the back behind your neck (not a problem if you have eyes in the back of your head).\n",
      "  - Connecting wires for the buds could be a tad longer.\n",
      "  - Sound could be fuller but probably decent for this price point.\n",
      "but none of these are a real reason to deduct a star Hell yeah The sound is really good considering these aren't super pricey earbuds. They are fairly comfortable to wear throughout the day. I have not tried to wear them while working out or running / jogging yet but it seems like they'd feel ok. Battery life has been good. I charged them the first day I got them and have used them for about 6-7 hours over the past week for calls and music and haven't had to charge them yet. They are a little awkward to store away in my backpack or purse as the main piece that sits around your neck is a little bit stiff. I feel afraid of breaking them if I just toss them in my backpack with all my other junk. So far, no breaking though. They seem sturdy. outstanding One of the best headsets i ever brought Great headset! Great Should have bought these first. Great sound and pairing is seamless. I really like these, easy to use and set up. The buttons are easy to reach and use, it's definitely not going to blast you out but that wasn't what I was looking for. Just got these yesterday. Easy to use sound is pretty good. Was a little surprised that they weren't flexible like the LG tones. They stay on place well though, sounds is pretty decent. Easy to pair. Bout sure about the 150ft range but they go a lot farther than my lg ones I can leave my phone upstairs and still get a connection. So far so good! best headphones for any occasion Its good.. Good sound, unbelievably long range, easily 50-60 feet.  not as comfortable as lg and the battery life isn't very reliable, something it gives me 8 hours sometimes only 4 hrs. I only use it to listen to audio books. keep up the good work Love them I bought these as a gift for my wife who just loves them I am a life and executive coach getting paid $100 to talk on the phone by clients. These work, perfectly! They feel well made, though I can't really speak on the durability(I've only had them a couple days). Clean sound with nice(not too much) bass. I'd buy them again. Amazing Earphones. The audio quality is really good for Bluetooth earphones. The ear-buds fit perfectly. Tried Bluetooth Earphones from different companies, had issues with either the fit or audio/video sync. This one is perfect both for Music and Videos. It has a built in Mic but have not tested it. Good battery life. Lasted almost 8 hours. love it These buds are awesome,  by far the best sounding Bluetooth headset I've used.  Sound quality and range are amazing. This headset definitely comes through.\n",
      "it works good with a couple of drawbacks.\n",
      "The volume does not seem like it gets loud enough.\n",
      "There is a problem when you look up it seems to cut out and get staticy. I think it has something to do with getting caught in the folds of your neck.\n",
      "those are my only complaints other than that it works fantastic!\n",
      "I would definitely buy this product again! Shipped quickly and is working great. The second one - my wife stole the first one.  These things are great.  Good sound quality.  Perfect for exercise and house/yard work.  Lightweight and durable.  Does not fit my neck well - I wear a size 17.5\" collar.  Probably a perfect fit under a size 16\". I first purchased and then returned the LG Tone+ headset which had issues working properly with my Samsung Galaxy Note 2. (Bluetooth would cut out and lock up my home screen when I carried phone in back pocket. Other times it would behave ok.  Also, the Tone would not work with out going calls--I could hear the other person, but they could not hear me.) I've read about others having this same problem, even with other brand phones. And plusses of the LG over the Motorola were not worth the hassle of trying to figure out of this could be remedied. In fact, others I read about could not find a fix for the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "I realize that Motorola Buds may not have all the features that the Tone+ has, but they pair and play perfectly with my phone.  They feel DIFFERENT than tone+ around the neck and in the ears, and music sounds slightly DIFFERENT; different isn't better or worse. I do find the earbud cords somewhat too short if I don't carefully roll the little rubber bands up towards the top of the neck band which gives them more leeway. Hopefully, the bands won't break like others have complained of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although I did like the controls and position of the buttons on the Tone+ better, I am very happy with my Motorola Buds.  I was recently using the Buds to speak with my sister who uses the LG Tone +(and both she and her husband have developed problems with their LG headsets similar to what I experienced). She had no idea I was on a bluetooth headset during the call, it sounded that good!  She is now watching for a good deal on Motorola Buds for herself. Absolutely love how these buds work without getting in my way or making me look like a space traveler. only drawback is that if you are listing to music or something you will have to reset it to heat your call. Best Bluetooth earbuds I've ever used. Just as good as any wired earbuds. The only times i've had problems with them is when I go into the house and upstairs while my phone is in the car or when working under the car. Great earbuds!!! These things are amazing. I love them! The one downside is this...if you're going to talk on the phone with these, the person on the other end is going to think you are in a train station. They desperately need noise canceling. I haven't found a single pair of bluetooth headphones yet that sound decent to talk on. I can hear fine, and the person on the other end can hear me fine....but they can hear everything else around me to such a degree that it's bothersome and distracting.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, I had no hopes of these performing well in that area anyways and bought them for music listening. So for my purpose, they get 5 stars. I would love to one day find a nice pair of bluetooth headphones like these that actually work well for phone calls too. Very good I like it Good Product and worth it. Great sound, awesome noise reduction,  excellent product. Very good sound, can here all the nuances of the music just like you were there in person. Much better than any of the ear buds I have been using plus I'm free to leave my phone on the charger while I go around the house doing what I need to with no worry about missing a call! works well with the iPhone 4 sounds clear on both ends when making calls. sounds amazing when listening to music. Glad i switched from the LG tone + to this. Bought this primarily to use under my motorcycle helmet because I was sick of running a cord to my phone under my jacket.\n",
      "-You can turn your head with no cords tugging, earbuds stay in the ears\n",
      "-The earbuds are small enough that they don't get caught when you take off your helmet.\n",

      "I have really weird shaped ears and can never find any in-ear bud style headphones that work.  This comes with three sizes of cushions, the default work perfect for me.  This headset, which I originally purchased to be used under my motorcycle helmet, have become my everyday use headphones.  I wear them at work and the base fits hidden perfectly under a collared shirt.\n",

      "I've been using them for two weeks without any issue.  I hope they are durable and continue to live up to my everyday use. Good My LG HBS-730 that I use for bike rides with no problem.  Recently, the route I took has a lot of interference from the near by power lines and tower.  Music from LG glitches so much that I can't enjoy my music anymore.  I also have a Plantronics BackBeat Go 2.  This one is a little bit better, but my music still glitches and break up at the area with the most interference.  My phone is a Samsung Galaxy S4 Active and it's stored in my bike jersey back pocket, which is less than two feet from the headset.\n",
      "Before I try this unit, I went and try a LG HBS-750 (one user review said it has less interference).  HBS-750 was worst.  It started to break up even before I enter the interference area.\n",
      "I finally give this one a try.  Wow, I don't know what kind of power they use, I had three rides so far and I haven't experience one single glitch yet.  No music break up, no phone call conversation break up.  It's so nice to finally have some uninterrupted music.\n",
      "\n",
      "I problem I had was that once time, I receive a phone call and the party on the other side couldn't hear me.  I don't know if it's the other party or the headset.  The party calls me back and this time, when I press the pickup button, the headset doesn't respond with button push.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound is very awesome as well.  I say the bass is better that the HBS-730.  The magnet is stronger as well.  I like it when I tuck the unit behind my shirt and when I am not using the ear plug and let it dangles, it naturally falls down and attached itself back to the magnet of the unit ... through my shirt.  This keep the earplug from swinging back and forth when I am not using it.  I don't know if this is by design or just accident.  Either way, it's cool. For years I have watched my husband struggle with his earbuds cord while cutting grass; which is why I decided to get the wireless headset.\n",
      "He has made comments that he likes the Motorola brand, that the brand has never caused him any issues, which is why I specifically bought Motorola.\n",
      "So far he loves them. They stay in his ears, the music sounds great, he hardly hears the background noise, calls sound good on both ends, and there is no cord to fight with. They fit around his neck loosely (he is 5'11 and 190lbs).  I am very pleased with my gift choice. The headset sounds excellent.  The earbuds will not aggravate your ears when they are in... even for long lengths of time.  I would definitely recommend these. The buds have a very good sound. they have a decent range. They are very comfortable to wear. the cord on the buds could be a little longer but other than that they are good. They are very light, so you reall don't feel them around your neck. if they could play the ringtones i have set for my contacts they would be awesome. After I got a Philips GoGear Ariaz MP3 player with Bluetooth, I wanted to get a pair of BT ear buds to cut the cords when I'm on the go.\n",
      "\n",
      "First I tried -- and wasted thirty bucks on -- a pair of no-name cheapo Chinese buds sold by an Amazon third-party vendor.  BIG mistake -- the buds wouldn't pair with the Ariaz, and the vendor ducked my questions about his return policy.  Grrr...\n",
      "\n",
      "So I came back to Amazon to check out customer reviews on other BT ear buds.\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounded as if these Motorola Buds were getting good reviews, so I picked up a pair (from a store in NYC with a guaranteed return policy) -- and I must say, they're outstanding!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me explain that I don't even have a smartphone, so I can't speak to these buds' capability handling phone conversations.  I ONLY wanted cordless buds so I could listen to music, and these Motos sound as good as any bud I've ever tried, including pairs from Bose, Klipsch, Sony, Sennheiser, you name it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Add to the sound quality the comfort and superb ergonomics at work here -- and I have a new favorite pair of ear buds!\n",
      "\n",
      "This behind-the-neck design is genius.  The necklace? yoke? carries the slight but sufficient weight of the electronics and battery so the buds don't keep falling out of your ears. You wear it inside the collar of your shirt, with the arms laying down in front.\n",
      "\n",
      "The yoke also has convenient controls at the front of both arms -- volume up and down on one side; play/pause, track advance/reverse, and EQ settings on the other.  The buttons are raised so you can feel and operate them with your fingers.  Excellent!\n",
      "\n",
      "Also cool is the way the buds attach magnetically to the ends of the necklace arms when you take them off.  Neat!\n",
      "\n",
      "I haven't fully tested battery life, but Motorola claims you get up to eleven hours of playtime on a 90-minute charge.  The buds come with a charger you plug into AC, plus a handy storage pouch and three sizes of bud tips to fit ear canals of different sizes.  I seem to be fine with the tips pre-installed, which I am guessing are the medium size.\n",
      "\n",
      "The box talks about noise-canceling technology, but I think they're referring to something useful for phone conversations.  I can still hear sounds in the environment when I'm listening to music, but it's not intrusive, and the music comes through loud and clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I have seen some reviews here saying these buds could have better bass or more volume.  Really?  As I said, the sound quality is superb on all types of music from classical to jazz to rock and soul, and the buds play as loud as you can stand without damaging your hearing.  I wonder if the complainers realize that you have to raise the volume on your BT player or smartphone to \"get in the zone.\"  And of course, as with any in-ear buds, you must make sure you're getting a proper seal, using the right size bud tips for your ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "Otherwise BT reception is splendid; I can lay the Ariaz down on a table and wander throughout my large studio apartment without any breakup or interference.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if you're looking for a superb pair of ear buds that cut the cord and sound fantastic, I give these Motos my highest recommendation -- this is a brilliant product!\n",

I like to provide as much detail as possible when I write a review, because thats the sort of thing I look for in other reviews. Buying things from online retailers is great and all, but it prevents us from getting any hands-on information until weve already shelled out our money. Detailed reviews are the best way to combat disappointment and buyers remorse. So either get some popcorn and/or a coffee, or skip to the end, or skip this review entirely   Seriously though, its a long review. Prepare yourself.\n",

      "This headset is about as close to ideal as I'm probably ever going to get, at least until headsets are implanted subdermally behind the ear, or when music and communications are beamed directly into the brain or something. It has great sound, features, fit, and looks. There are a few downsides which I'll get out of the way first, and then I can get back to gushing about this thing. First, I feel that the earbud cords are maybe .5 to .75 inches too short. I wear this mainly when Im at work, underneath the collar of my polo shirt. The cords therefor have to dip down under the edge of the collar, and then make the trip back up to my ears. It's fine if I'm looking straight ahead, but if I turn my head too much it will tug on the 'outside' ear (if I look left, it tugs on my right ear and vice versa). I've gotten around this somewhat by removing the little silicone o-rings that are intended to manage the earbud cords. It releases a little more cord length so the tugging is less noticeable, but it is still there. The cords are a bit short for my taste even when wearing a t-shirt, but aren't too bad. The next downside is that the headset does not support connection to two devices at once. I get that this one device at a time thing improves the handoff between music and calls, since this is easier when both services are provided by one phone/device, but I still wish I could listen to my personal phone's music collection while being able to take calls from my work phone. Other headsets like the Sony MW600 handle this with ease. I should clarify that the Buds can be PAIRED with multiple devices, but can only be connected to one device at a time. Currently, Ive got them paired with my Android tablet and phone, my iPod, and my work iPhone. I can switch from one to another by manually disconnecting from one and connecting to another (via each devices settings), so I don't have to go through the pairing process every time I want to switch  pairing the Buds is not difficult at all, but that would get annoying real quick.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that I've got that out of the way, I can talk about the stuff I like about the Buds, which is pretty much everything. First off, let me assure you that this headset DOES support Apt-X Bluetooth connections where available. Apt-X is a Bluetooth audio codec that is designed to provide sound quality equal to a wired headset. Other Bluetooth audio connections have to compress the audio, making it sound somewhat muddled and, well, bad. This happens regardless of the quality of your source audio file. Apt-X support is most commonly available in recent Samsung (including the Galaxy S3, S4, and S5) and HTC phones (including the One and M8), but there are others out there as well. If you're interested, there is a ridiculously complete .xlsx spreadsheet available from jessebandersen dot com, but a simple Google search will also yield results. I found Jesses page by searching for aptx enabled devices  it was the first result in the list. Sadly Apt-X is not supported by Apple yet, and knowing them they'll come out with some proprietary alternative to it that only works with their own headsets (they bought Beats by Dre in the last week or so, so get ready). I almost passed on the Buds because Apt-X isn't listed anywhere in the specs or reviews that I saw here on Amazon. I had to go to Motorola's site and look up the user manual to find it. I was originally going to go with the LG Tone headset line (which also supports Apt-X), but didn't like the \"flat loop\" design that most of them have  it looks like a great fit for a robot. In my opinion the Buds are designed for a better fit on an actual human: the front of the control stalks bend gently down, following the curve of the neck/shoulders/collarbones. The majority of the headset (including the very small weight of the battery pack) rests on the base of your neck, and the control stalks rest comfortably near the collarbones. The LG Tone can't do both at the same time since it is formed in a flat circle: the stalks aren't angled relative to the neck band, and they carry all the weight of the battery so theyll fall to your collarbones while the center section will be halfway up the back of your neck (the newer ones are curved like the Buds, but are $70 more expensive). Im wearing the Buds headset right now, and can hardly feel it  a great improvement over traditional earhugger Bluetooth headsets. While Im talking about fit, I should probably mention that I wear a 17.5 collar, and cant stand having things touching my neck or throat. The Buds fit quite comfortably, and provide just the slightest reassuring touch on the front sides of my neck. They widest gap between the left and right control stalks measures just a hair under 5 inches.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Buds have a tidy control arrangement and are easy to navigate. Play/pause/answer/end/track-skip commands (as well as EQ settings and voice dial activation) are handled by a rocker switch on the left, and volume adjustments are handled by a rocker switch on the right. The microphone is underneath the rocker switch on the left, and the power switch is underneath the body (center section) of the headset, next to the charging port. Play/pause/answer/end is done by a single press of the forward half of the left rocker switch, which has a little bit of texture to it for identification/grip purposes. You can activate voice dialing (like Siri or Samsungs S-Voice or Google voice search) by long-pressing this same button while no music is playing. Track-skip forward is done by a single press of the back half of the same switch, and track-skip back is done by a double press. I kind of wish skip forward/back were handled by separate buttons, but its easy enough to get used to. One thing to note about the mic being on the same stalk as the answer/end button: if you have to feel around for the end call button, the person on the other end is going to hear ALL OF IT since the microphone is right beneath it. Lots of loud rustling noises. Oops. Not enough for me to list as a full-on downside, but still... kind of annoying. They could have placed the mic on the right, which come to think of it is a whole lot less busy since it mostly only has volume control functions. Volume down is achieved by pressing the forward half of the right rocker switch, and volume up by pressing the back half. You can mute an active phonecall by pressing both portions of the volume rocker, and reject an incoming call by long-pressing either one of the volume buttons. EQ modes can be changed by a long-press of the Play/Pause switch on the left. There are 3 EQ modes, but there is no indication of which one you are in, or documentation of what the effects are supposed to be. There is a voice notification of EQ mode changed! but thats it. Youre on your own to figure out exactly what that means. My best guess is that the modes are flat, treble boost, and bass boost. As a general audiophile rule, flat EQ response is best since it doesnt meddle with the sound balance and you hear it as the artist intended. I can barely tell which EQ mode is bass boost, but cant tell the difference between the other two. And if I cant tell the difference, then I guess it doesnt really matter. Id recommend switching modes while listening to your general type of music, getting to an EQ setting you like, and then never changing it again. As is obvious from the pictures and literature, the earbuds are held magnetically to the ends of the control stalks when not in use. The magnets are pretty strong, and the earbuds have yet to bounce themselves loose. In fact, they are so strong that if I remove an earbud from my ear but don't attach it to the end of the stalk, Ill eventually find that it has connected itself at some point as Ive been moving around. Needless to say, don't get any of these parts too close to any of your credit cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as sound quality goes, Im really impressed. The earbuds are said to have Premium HD speakers, and whatever that truly means, they sound great and the Apt-X support really helps them shine. I should point out that the Buds will still sound great with non-Apt-X devices like Apple gadgets, and will certainly sound as good as all other Bluetooth headsets that don't support it. As long as the earbuds are seated properly (which is critical with any in-ear earbuds) bass response is nice and solid, and everything just sort of sparkles. Not saying that sparkle is added in any way, but if the music has fine detail in it then youll hear a lot more of it. Speaking of having the earbuds seated properly, the documentation talks a bit about about micro-adjustability, and what this translates into is that the stem of each earbud can pivot a certain amount around a central axis in a sort of narrow cone shape, so the angle of the stem relative to the earbuds body can change a bit to fit different peoples ear structures. The earbuds seem to stay fairly well seated unless I get really sweaty. Speaking of sweat, I will also note that the Buds are not labelled as sweat proof, which does make me worry a little bit. I sweat easily, and do a lot of biking and walking, and my work is somewhat physical too. Hopefully this does not become an issue. There is a little rubber plug you have to partially remove to access the charging port, so make sure you place it back securely before getting sweaty. Anyways, back to audio quality: One important thing to note, which is true of all high quality sound delivery devices, is that the final output depends highly on good source material. You should know by now that low quality sources like 128Kbps .mp3 files or even some tracks on Pandora and other streaming services aren't the best, and with these you will hear every little bit of their badness. Other headsets may mask this but they're also masking the fine detail of better quality files, so in a way its actually a good thing. Call quality on both ends of the line is really good as well, and Ive never had anyone ask Are you using Bluetooth? which I usually get when I use other headsets. In fact, I had one person stop me in mid-conversation and ask Didnt you say you were going to put on your bluetooth headset?, and almost didn't believe me when I said I already had. One last thing about audio quality  if you listen to music via any app with preamp gain, you may want to be reduce that gain level to zero. I use PowerAmp on my Galaxy S4 and was dismayed at first to hear a ton of distortion, especially in the low end. I almost returned the headset because I could not get rid of it. I eventually found that the preamp gain (on PowerAmps EQ settings page) was set to about 75% of its capacity, and turning it down eliminated the distortion completely. You can get rid of the distortion at 25%, but why risk it? I keep it at zero now just to be sure. Doing so also reduced the overall volume, but since these things get plenty loud on their own, I don't mind at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually I hate the looks of most Bluetooth headsets: the obnoxious blinking blue lights and the giant blobs of techno-crud clamped to peoples ears make them look like extras from bad 80s sci-fi movies. I have to say that the Motorola Buds practically disappear, especially while wearing them under the collar of a polo shirt. They do have an indicator light, but it is nestled in between the power switch and charging port, so its not visible at all while they're being worn. I have to say, at first I wasn't too pleased with the fact that even the black headset has white bits on it (the undersides of the flat cords, the silicone ear pieces, and the forward/inside halves of the earbud shells). I have changed my mind and have very much come to enjoy the subtle high-contrast design. It looks nice and modern without looking like its trying too hard. As I said, it practically disappears under a polo collar  all you can see is the white silicone ear pieces and a touch of the white from the cord. When youve got an earbud inserted, the white flash from the undersides of the cords help make it a little more obvious to others that you're either listening to music or talking on the phone. I say a little because people still give me weird looks when they walk into a room while Im in mid conversation. I have to make the universal Im not a lunatic, Im just on the phone gesture to most folks, but the observant ones can figure it out for themselves more easily. I see these now come in blue, which makes me even more sad that they don't come in red. You see, I have a sickness. A sickness which has yet to be defined (or even acknowledged) by Science, in which I have an overwhelming love (some, like my wife, would say unhealthy obsession) for black things with red trim, or red things with black trim, or  well, you get the idea. If these came in red, Id sell 4 of my 5 pints of blood (or at least my black/white Buds) to get a set. Maybe one day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those are the main points I wanted to talk about. There are a few more things that don't really fit in the review elsewhere, so Ill stick them here. The specs say that the wireless range is up to 150 feet, but that is with a Class 1 Bluetooth device, which your phone probably isnt. Realistic use is still around 30 to 40 feet, with minor barriers like walls and doors. I don't even know where to find a true Class 1 Bluetooth device, so get that 150ft range spec out of your head. Battery life seems to be pretty good, and although I try to charge the headset every night, Ive gone as far as 2 full workdays of mixed usage without running out of battery. Theyre rated at up to 12 hours of playback, but its anyones guess as to what that actually means. I talked about the silicone earpieces earlier, but forgot to mention that they come in 3 sizes  small, medium, and large. The Buds come with the small ones installed already, but I found that the mediums were best for me. The earpieces on most of my other earbuds (both wired and wireless) are 99% interchangeable, but these are slightly different. The posts on the ear stems are a slightly smaller diameter than standard, so earpieces from other sets are a bit loose. Swapping other earpieces to the Buds would result in more sound leakage and result in poorer sound quality and bass response, and also put you at a much higher risk of having one of the earpieces coming off the stem and sticking in your ear. Trust me, you don't want that. Stick to the 3 sizes provided and find the one that best suits you. Use the biggest size you can stand, because a good seal is critical for good sound quality. Another thing I mentioned briefly was the Buds voice notifications. The Buds have a set of pre-programmed voice notifications built in that youll hear as you turn the headset on and off, or change EQ settings, and maybe a few other commands. When you power it up, the headset plays a short musical tune and then a chipper female voice says Welcome to the Motorola Buds! When you connect to a phone or mp3 player, the same voice says Device 1 connected! The voice isn't too bad, but it took me a while to get used to. When you receive a phone call, it will play another tune at you instead of mirroring your phones ringtone. I think its a riff on the first few notes of Ride of the Valkyries but I could be wrong. The Buds also play a soft bloop noise every time you play or pause or adjust the volume. Other than these bloop noises, there is really no indication of whether or not the unit is even powered up. I mention this because if the headset loses connection it will automatically power down after 5 minutes to save battery. If you pick the headset up after a while and don't know what power state its in, hit a volume button and listen for the bloop. The headset has yet to drop Bluetooth connection on its own, which is a first for all the headsets Ive owned and is kind of impressive. The very last thing I wanted to talk about (yeah, I made a list) is that there are very thin rubber strips that run up the undersides of each control stalk, which I think serve the purpose of covering the track the wires run through. A small section of one of these strips popped up after about a week and would not seat itself back down. I eventually decided that they are probably held in place by some sort of adhesive, since I could not get it to pop back in, so I placed the tiniest dab of Krazy Glue in there, wiped off the excess, and held it in place until it dried. This was about a month ago, and it has not popped back up yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "So thats absolutely every observation about the Motorola Buds that Ive made since I got them. If youve read through all that, I salute you. I probably owe you 20 minutes of your life back. Sorry about that. Now on to the summary, which I promised at the start:\n",
      "\n",
      "For the tl;dr crowd, I wholly approve of this headset. Its the headset Ive been waiting quite some time for, and its finally here. Features, fit, sound, and looks are all pretty much perfect, and its hard to come up with a list of serious disadvantages. As I write this, its available here for $58, which is quite a steal. The nearest competitor is the LG HBS-800, which normally goes for $130. Check these out  I don't think youll be disappointed. VERY COMFORTABLE, CLEAR VOLUME AND GREAT FITTTING AROUND YOUR NECK. DON'T TURN AROUNDYOUR NECK AS MUCH AS THE LG. GREAT ALL OK, PERFECT! Works great.  Comfortable.  And at the price, its actually a better buy, in my opinion, than the Lg tone.  Tried the tone headset, and liked the feel of this one better.  Pair's easily. Great sound quality, and buds fit great.  And, most importantly for me, lasts all day on a single charge!  Have had for about 2 months now, and love it. I'm giving this product 5-Stars as I find it to be just about what I'm looking for in a headset.  Some have criticized the sound quality, but I found it to be stellar with the Buds.  I own the LG-Tone and will definitely say that this device is a notch above in terms of build quality, range, and sound.  The only area the LG may have a leg up on this headset is in regards to having vibration, multi-sync with more than one device and that it can accommodate larger sized necks due to it's flexibility.  I'm a big guy and have about a 17.5 to 18 inch neck, and this fits me find.  I noticed that I do, ever so slightly, feel the Buds on my neck in the front, if I really think about it.  I believe that if I loose a few pounds then this would not be present at all.  It's really not a big deal and as I said, barely noticeable for me.  That being said, I notice it just as much as I notice the LG-Tone, due to the extra weight the Tone carries on the stems.  I much prefer the build quality and back loaded weight of the Buds, which puts the weight at the back of you rather than the front of your neck.  The problem this cause with the Tone is that when I bend over or lay back, they device would shift due to the weight and fall/slip off.  This doesn't seem to be a problem with the Buds, due to the weight being more balanced and even.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound as I stated is quality.  The settings right out of the box carried a LOT of bass.  Honestly they sound like really premium ear buds with excellent sound.  I never tried listening to them with the mid-sized ear buds that come pre-installed.  I immediately put on the larger ear buds (3 sizes come with it) and found that there was no problem for me at all.  I watched the two reviews by Clint Gibbs on YouTube and followed his advice regarding putting the appropriate buds in your ear.  I HIGHLY suggest you putting the ones that fit best in your ear on prior to first using.  Make sure the buds give a light seal in your ear when they are inserted.  This should not need to fit deep into your ear, nor feel like it is going to fall out.  The right fit forms a \"sound seal\" perfectly in your ear and feels very comfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regards to pairing, controls, and functionality, these are really easy to learn and will do everything that meets my needs.  Sync with my Galaxy Note 2 was quick and flawless.  The connection stays and it pics up any audio/sound coming from your device.  Some have mentioned that the lack of vibration is an issue for them.  I actually haven't seen this as a real problem, although I would like to see if Motorola adds the feature to future versions of the Buds.  That being said, they work just fine for calls and everyone I have spoken to so far has stated that call quality was excellent.  I have owned other Motorola BT headsets before and like them, this one is a winner in my book.  I would easily say that this is the best BT headset on the market for those looking for something that they don't have to have on their ear all the time and want quality A2DP stereo sound and crystal clear calling, all while being hands free and wireless. For the price this is a great Headset, I use the 510 headset from plantronics, and bought this one for my wife. She really don't use it much, but I've linked it up to 2 different cell phones and my laptop, worked great. It is a little bulkier and heavier than the 510. Other than that it is simple and is a great buy if you don't need the multilink capability of the 510. This is a great earpiece at half the cost of others. It's easy to use and fairly light. The button on the mic lets you answer, redial and voice dial without opening your phone. The only downside is you have to turn the earpiece off and on again if you lose signal to your phone and need to poll to reconnect. I have previously owned the v400, v525, v600, and now the v710. I am definitely glad I switched, this was the nicest and most reliable phone out of those. My only complaint with these Verizon phones is with the antenna size. This is a mid-priced phone, with solid features all-around, including bluetooth, good reception, nice compact size, and good battery life.  If you buy it with those expectations, you'll be very happy with it.  Compared to the higher-end phones though, it has some drawbacks.\n",

If you compare to similar price-point phones, this one is a very good value. This phone is great and with great features!!!

      "For me this phone is a great deal even by the price $76.00 brand new!!  I bought it direct from Verizon, the discount I got was due to my husband's corporate discount, so in all, I cannot complain about the phone, but I keep reccomending people not to hook up with Verizon.  I am \"serving time\" with them for the next 2 years because I wanted this phone. There is no free lunch. I have loved the switch from T-Mobile.  Every day is new experience.  I will highly recommend Verizon Wireless with a Droid phone any day. awsome Gave these away as a gifts and haven't had one complaint yet. Excellent GOOD loveem why? test it. try it. Great price fast shipping very pleased Read a lot of reviews saying these don't work but I can attest that in a metal building they will give you at lest one extra bar of signal. great product at a great price Good little product, but it won't give you more than an extra bar. These antenna boosters really help to add to my cellphones ability to pick up a signal. In my area i normally only get 1 bar after adding this i get 2-3 bars now. So it helps. It gives more bars then had before. Such a perfect item. Made my bf very happy as well. So perfect of an item. I tried these antenna's to help my wife with her cell phone issues. They actually improved her cell service so I added one to my HTC EVO 4G LTE, it has helped improve my signal service. If you are having issues I recommend these! Forgot I had this on my phone until I got the request to review it. But, my phone has been working exceptionally well lately...because of these boosters!! I have a Blackberry Torch. You just put this sticky little piece of film by your battery and *viola* you have way better reception!! Seems to do the trick. Recommend!! And it's a great price to boost your phone's antenna. Item received matched description. I'm glad I brought this device. I have magnet waves throughout my apartment. They're strongest in my bedroom. I can't rearrange my room. I tried pulling the bed from the wall as far as I can. I was shocked as I check electrical devices. Some of them still emit electrical and magnetic energy when they're turned off. I live in an old building. Computer, monitor, and Wi-Fi box all transmit strong, dangerous waves. My Sony TV seems to be okay, It might be well shielded. It was the only device I checked that I didn't get any readings. When the refrigerator's motor turns on, the magnetic reading are high. Great and Simple Meter.  Every Heart Patient need one.  It has solved a couple medical problems for me. OMG I had no idea why I was getting so ill. This told me why! The power conditioner on my desk was off the scale. Our hybrid car was off the scale, and tried to go further off the scale when you press the break peddle. All our \"energy saving\" light bulbs were off the scale. Now we're testing everything and we're in a MUCH better environment. Both of us are concentrating better, sleeping better and generally feeling better.\n",
      "Can't recommend this enough!!! Get it! You'll be shocked at what's going on around you! Seems to work well and saved us from living in a seemingly very desirable ground floor apartment which had a couple of power lines running directly under the floors of the bedrooms! The meter maxed out when positioned at certain places on the floor in these rooms... There is enough scientific evidence that long-term exposure to EMFS may be dangerous. No conspiracy theory needed. The principle of precaution fully applies. My local electricity provider states in one of its publications that \"Without exception, these major reviews have reported that the body of data, as large as it is, does not demonstrate that exposure to power-frequency magnetic fields causes cancer or other health risks, although the possibility cannot be dismissed. Most reviews recommend further research, and, appropriately, research is ongoing worldwide.\" Yeah, I think I'll pass! solid tool, even compact enough, very sensitive and measures all the common radiation types. very handy Great device Great product. High quality. Recommend. Great price I bought this to measure the radiation coming from my phone and microwave. It worked great and I found out I need to be about 5 feet away from my microwave to not get any radiation. And for my phone, it just spikes when a call comes through or when a text comes in or out. Love this meter Works Great! Works well as expected. Used it to check a house that I bought before i bought it. Could see the weak spots and could see that most of the house was Ok so I bought the house. GREAT METER FOR EMF. Great meter for measuring magnetic fields.  The top two gauges allow one to measure these fields at different levels of detail.  We use the middle gauge the most.  The bottom gauge, for measuring RF, isn't quite as functional.  RF is best measured with a meter specialized for that spectrum. Great measurement tool. I am definitely a newbie to using items like this Trifield meter.  So far it does everything it was advertised as being able to do.  Now I need to learn more about using it. After reading about EMF pollution I decided on this meter. It's not a \"toy\" and not cheap. So far I discovered low but dangerous levels of leaking radiation from our 20-year-old microwave oven. Will probably replace the oven but for now I don't stand in front of it while it's on. At least awareness is very smart to have. Works great Short version:\n",
      "If you're reading these reviews, you probably already know what these meters are for.  In short, this one seems to be a good one, and my wife and I recommend it.  We were looking at a house that was right next to large power lines and had heard mixed stories about whether they are dangerous or not for kids.  We wanted to check and this meter was a decent price, so we gave it a try.  It worked well, was easy to use, and helped us make an informed decision.  If you know you want to buy an EMF meter, this is one of the better ones.  I recommend this meter to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long version:\n",
      "We were looking at buying a house very close to larger power lines.  Not the biggest high-voltage kinds, but not the normal lines either.  We read a lot of studies from Canada, the UK, the US, and from Asia, and some studies said there was a health risk for young kids from electro-magnetic fields of certain strengths.  But there were also studies that said there was no risk or, if there was a risk, it was very very small.  We looked at big studies, little studies, government studies, private studies, we couldn't find one consistent answer. Our home inspection companies did not have EMF meters, so we looked at a number of options to get a test.  Because of the disagreement in the reports, we decided to just buy a meter to test ourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "This meter, unlike many, has multiple sensors so you don't have to continuously spin it while using it.  Other meters that have just one sensor say in their instructions to do so.  If you spin it incorrectly, you could get an inaccurate reading.  We aren't experts in using these things, and we wanted an accurate reading, so we went with this meter.  We tested it in a hotel room, in a house, in the yard, by power lines, and by various electronics and other items.  The meter gave consistent readings for the items and places we tested.  It is easy to read and easy to use.  Based on our meter readings and the studies, we were able to make an informed decision about the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, the way the meter works is the dial at the bottom has different settings for different things you'd test for.  We were only testing for EMF from power lines, so we only used two of those settings.  Those EMF settings let you control which of the three lines you see on the screen are in use.  For example, if you set it to one of the settings (Magnetic 0-100), it will look for EMF and use the top line on the meter.  That line is for higher readings, and it measures between 0 and 100 milliguass (1 milligauss is equal to .1 microtesla if you're trying to measure in microtesla).  So if you have a strong magnetic field, you'd need to set the meter to 0-100 and look at the top line.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you set it to \"magnetic 0-1,\" another EMF setting, you'd get a more precise reading using the middle line of the meter.  On the big meter setting (0-100), you might see that you have between 1 and 2 milligaus, but not know exactly what number.  But on the 0-3 setting, you could see if you have 1.2, 1.5, 1.7, etc.  For most residential/non-professional uses, you probably don't need to be that precise, but for people using this professionally, I suspect that setting would help more.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also used the meter, like other reviewers, around various electronics in our home.  We were surprised to see that, if you put this in front of a microwave within a few feet, you'll go off the scale on even the 0-100 meter.  I read about other reviewers doing that and being startled.  There's nothing like seeing it yourself.  I'm not really a big worrier about EMF, but after seeing that with my own eyes, I don't stand by the microwave when it's in use.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, this seems to be a great meter.  It met our needs.  So, I recommend it to others. I used this device while house shopping.\n",
      "\n",
      "It works exactly as advertised. It was able to pick up a powerful military radar at a range of approximately 6 miles, which was impressive because the single was fairly weak at that distance. Every time the radar swept the hill, the needle would tick.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also very good at picking up high voltage lines. One house I looked at had a very powerful regional distribution line running under the street -- the line was so strong that it pinned the needle past the highest tick mark! Good value in being able to measure magnetic fields, electrical fields, and radio fields.  I used it to measure electrical fields in our new place.  Took it to a lamp store to find lamps with lower electrical fields.  Most modern lamps are fine...if you're in the next room.  Awful lot of electrical energy from lights.  This meter showed me how quickly the fields drop off, so I can estimate how far we have to be from the lamp to be within safe limits.  Meter is not particularly biased as to field direction, so it's easy to detect any field. I got this to measure EMF around my new house, and use it to move electronic devices around to keep them further away from where I usually am.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example:\n",
      "*CFL lights max out this meter in the magnetic, electric, and radio bands. I now try to keep them up and away about 4' from where I sit/work.\n",
      "*LCD monitors don't put off anything but a little bit of magnetic within 1'.\n",
      "*My PC puts off a large magnetic field so I no longer have that sitting next to me.\n",
      "*Helps you locate faulty wiring in houses - you should be able to pick up a little bit of Electric (AC) energy around outlets, but if it spikes there's probably something wrong.\n",
      "*I have cell phone amplifiers, wifi routers, cellphone microcell stations, and regular AM/FM powered antennas. The \"Radio/Microwave\" setting doesn't really spike out next to these devices unless I'm within 5ft of them - rather odd.\n",
      "*Some fans put off magnetic/electric energy that can be detected for 20ft through walls.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're going to test things in your house you might want to make sure everything else is off first - so you don't get any false readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a handy and informative tool to have, trifield is a well recognized name by many enthusiasts. I wish the price were cheaper, but it's solid unit, and should I don't see it failing ever. Am I glad I bought this?  Oh yeah...now that I know my paper shredder, which sits right next to my desk chair, is creating the highest electro-magnetic field in the house.  The needle spiked up to the highest red level and stayed there.  Scary.  How does one shred paper from a distance? And the simple fans that create a nice cooling breeze?  High.  And the microwave?  Unstable...high, then backs off, then high. I won't be standing in front of it waiting for my hot drink anymore.  But my large plasma TV?  Almost nothing. I had to put the meter up to within two inches of the screen before it even registered.  And my cell phone, surprisingly low.  I like that it has meter levels for different EMF's, electric and radio waves; a replaceable 9V battery; and it's light and simple to use with one hand.  Very glad I bought it. Those pesky ghosts were always sneaking up on me and saying \"boo!\" but now I can have a warning that is early enough and spin around before they can get to me, and perform a quick exorcism, sending them back to Hades.\n",

      "Wonderful product! WHAT A WONDERFUL DEVICE,I HAD A PORTABLE BLUE TOOTH DEVICE THAT I HAD PURCHASED, SOMETIMES IT WOULD WORK AND SOMETIMES IT WOULD NOT, SO I READ ABOUT PARROT BLUE TOOTH DEVICES AND DECIDED TO GIVE IT A TRY, WELL AFTER A WEEK OF USING IT I AM VERY IMPRESSED. THE UNIT WORKS THRU THE BOSE SYSTEM IN MY CAR AND ALWAYS PAIRS UP AUTOMATICLY WHEN I ENTER MY CAR AND DOWN LOADS MY TELEPHONE CONTACTS AS WELL INTO ITS MEMORY , AND THE SOUND QUALITY IS EXCELLENT!! MY BUSINESS CALLS WORK VERY WELL BOTH INCOMING AND OUT GOING, PEOPLE TELL ME I SOUND AS THOUGH I AM ON A LAND LINE PHONE, AND CANT BELIEVE I\"M TALKING TO THEM ON A BLUE TOOTH DEVICE. I MUST ALSO SAY THAT THE CALLER I.D. IS VERY NICE AS WELL, SO I CAN GLANCE DOWN TO SEE WHO IS CALLING AND DECIDE IF I WANT TO TAKE THE CALL OR  NOT. THIS REALLY IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT, I HIGHLY RECCOMEND IT........ The installation of the Parrot was easy after getting the optional cable for a '09 Charger.  It's great how it uses the car stereo even with the stereo turned off.  When a call comes in it mutes the music then uses the volume set by the Parrot, not the volume the music was set to.  This bluetooth and a Garmin GPS was way cheaper than the factor options for these simple two things (gps/bluetooth option is over $2k while it costs under $400 to add these yourself.

I don't find the web surfing that useful (speed is about like a 28kbps dial-up connection) but for email it is superior to the Blackberry 957 I used a number of years ago.  The interface for the phone and for email and the address book is great.  Far better than any Nokia phone I have ever used.  The intellisync software allows me to create use a separate address book in Outlook that I can then sync with the SKII with a one button push.  Very simple and means you can have an abreviated address book if you are concerned about having this infor resident on TMO/Danger's servers.

This varies - as long as they have a filename that ends in .vcf and a mime type of text/x-vcard or text/directory, and otherwise are formatted correctly, they will get taken. But, some applications, for example, evolution, that great Linux e-mail application, does not give something that was never a file a meaningless filename, so the sidekick will not file evolution's vcards (unless you export them to a file and resend them with the right mime type).\n",

You might say, \"With a regular browser, why would I care about a WAP browser?\" - The answer is bandwidth - you want to look up a phone number, WAP will be faster.  And there are some cool wap games. But the real answer, according to the T-Mobile Tech supervisor is that the WAP browser is vaporware - it does not work.  Maybe someday.  There are sites you can't browse without javascript that have working wap analogues (like microsoft's sms generation site).  So you can't browse them at all from the phone.\n",

Oh, yes, I also built names with a formula. Saved it as a comma file, just like Outlook had, and, poof, in about a minute, a couple hundred phone numbers, addresses, and names migrated and merged and appeared on my phone.

There are lots of disconnects, mostly related to when you stop typing to think for a couple of minutes, but a program available in Linux called \"screen\" allows you to save programs running in the background and reconnect to them, see their output, get status, and all that stuff.

Great product, highly recommend!! Work good and cabel is exate long They r a good price and it works a win win situation.  People have no problem hearing me or I them . My wife uses this at work and had been using this for a year and it still works. I normally buy every 3 months because she breaks them. This is the only one that lasted more than 3 months.

The New-Age Treo's are the best smart devices ever made! I have used the T-Mobile Sidekick, the AT&T Motorola MPX, a Nextel Blackberry, a Samsung i600, and even an older style Treo in the form of the Treo 300. And out of every smart device I have ever used, the Treo 600 and 650 are 1000 times better then any of them!\n",

I often lay in my bed at night surfing the web for hours and hours, and by the time I am ready to go to sleep, my Treo 600 and 650 still have enough battery life to go a few more rounds.\n",

      "3# Because the Treo's are so popular the prices for accessories, software, add-on's, ect are Much cheaper then those for the other types of smart devices on the market. There is even talk by Palmone to start using Linux as the Palmsource software core, so there will be even more software available. And because Linux is open source, the phones will eventually be cheaper then those running the Microsoft Pocket PC. With the added bonus of the dependability of Linux!\n",
      "\n",
      "4# Because the Treo's are of the Candy-Bar style design, they are much easier to talk on. Because there is no flip, or antenna to fumble with.\n",

      "5# There is a software lancher called \"ZLauncher\" which has many features for your Treo's software interface. One of which allows you to see the exact level of signal strength. By using this tool you can so how much better the Treo's antenna and related components work, compared to any other phone on the market. I get a great signal with Sprint, but with Sprint and my Treo, my service is even better! I get signals with my Treo in places where my Sanyo and LG did not. In fact, I get better signal strength with my Treo, then my friends get with their phones!\n",
      "\n",
      "6# Palmone has a patent on a new design of smart device that they are working to bring to the market. A design nothing like the designs currently available. A PDA phone that will be thinner and still able to have a large full color screen and keyboard. SO the next generation of Treo's will be even better!\n",
      "\n",
      "The only downfall to the Palmone Treo's today, is price. That is because they are still new to the PDA phone market. Once they start making more and more phones, the prices will come down. And once they restructure their PDA manufacturing and company purpose in general, the prices will come down. I don't normally write reviews on phones, because I used to be a Die-Hard Motorola phone fan, and I guess still am. But if Palmone keeps making phones this perfect, then I will only buy their phones for the rest of my life! I can not say enough good things about these phones! Try one and see what I am talking about. Use it with Sprint PCS's $10 unlimited Visions access!\n",

      "Russell I've had the Treo 650 for months, and agree with most other raters that it had problems.  It reset spontaneously, had 50% less usable memory than the 600 and the phone quality was not as good.  Palmone has updated the ROM now and fixed all these problems.  My usable memory went from 5 mb to almost 11mb, and the phone is now completely stable.  No need for reservations anymore.  The ROM update is not yet available for Cingular, but will be, I suppose, eventually. Excellent buy as you can create your own cig lighter socket anywhere you want in your car, add extras, etc.  No longer slaved to what you got in your stock vehicle.  I have one going to the rear seats and one to the trunk so I can use it as a socket for my tire air inflator.

This was exactly the part I needed to help wire my dashcam to my fuse box in my truck (along with a \"Add-a-Circuit\" splitter).\n",

Keeps my work space a lot cleaner with only one cable, (not including mouse). love this.  it works as designed and it is easy to use.  it does provide a lot of light to sleep next to, so when friends stay in the spare room, we have to cover it with a towel. Purchased December 2008. Works exactly as advertised. I like this so much that I ordered another one as backup should mine ever fail.

When plugged in to an outlet, it will support 2 HDDs, a external ODD, and a printer with no issues.  Also, during a move I misplaced my power cord, so I called up the company...

      "Over the past several years, I've gotten a number of USB hubs to handle the problem.  I bought a 7-port CyberPower Hub from another vendor to use at work.

I was somewhat disappointed that the green port indicator lights were just green lights and didn't function as true indicators to let me know which port(s) were active at the moment. And, like another reviewer, I like having a port on the face of the hub. I use a lot of micro SD cards from my digital cameras, PDA, digital voice recorder, etc., and having a port on the front let's me plug in a micro USB reader and pop those micro cards in and out as I need them (I'm running Windows 7, so I don't need to ask Windows to \"remove\" them for me). Data transfers among the hub attached devices is 100%, no lapses, no losses. I'm very happy with this CyberPower hub. I think you will be too. I bought this one based on all the good user reviews and its popularity.  I had to replace an older D-Link USB that just didn't seem to work at all on both our mac's and PC's (I had two D-Link's).  I had hoped this Hub would actually work unlike the D-Link hub and it does the job great!\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought two and hooked one up to the PC and the other to the Mac and plugged 7 devices into each.  Everything worked and I did use the power just to make sure I could charge off of it if I wanted to.  This hub works perfect and the LED's look awesome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very happy with this product and would buy same one if I needed another USB hub.  Of course I'm sure the 3.0 versions will soon start to proliferate but until then this is a great USB hub and priced well for what you get. I use this on my MacBook so I can connect several items at the same time including a USB keyboard and optical mouse, my iPad and iPhone, a webcam, an external hard drive and even a light o Rama controller for my Christmas lights. This thing works great and provides plenty of power for all devices. I haven't seen any slowness in my webcam, iPad/iPhone syncing or even copying large movies to my external hard drive. This guy works great and I am not at all disappointed in performance. I am however a bit disappointed in the design. This has to sit on the corner of my desk and i need plenty of room on both sides to allow the USB cables to plug in. I would have had them design it like a tower with the plugs all on the back one on top of another. That being said, the current design does offer some added stability to keep the hub from falling over. Overall a great performer and a decent design. 1. The USB ports on the sides are spaced far enough apart that I can use all the slots. And the one in front is great for the thumb drive.\n",
      "2. The lights are cool\n",
      "3. It works great\n",
      "4. It stands up most of the time! when I came into the office this morning it was on it's side but no biggie. I righted it and it was fine all day. The weighted base does make a difference and I think they made it as heavy as they could without taking away the portability feature.\n",
      "5. Did I mention it works great. My laptop had no problem going to sleep. It was instantly recognized. All the devices I've put on it have been recognized\n",
      "6. I don't know what one reviewer meant by it making noise. Mine is absolutely silent.\n",
      "7. I agree you need a scissors or knife to open the clamshell packaging no biggie.\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked it so much I bought a second one!! Like all the other reviews the base is not heavy enough to hold the unit steady but I don't move the cables so it doesn't matter too much.  I like the port on the front for flash drives.  I think the blue power light is too bright.  All the green lights stay on so they are not very usefull for anything.  I prefer a light to be on when that port is used and change color if the port is overloaded.  Everything that has been plugged into the hub works properly.  With USB webcams I notice a little more noise than when plugged directly into my Dell. I have mac and this hub is great.  I like the front port for connecting items for occasional use. I have an older computer with ony 4 usb ports and a laptop with 2 usb ports. I have 4  external drives and a printer and various other devices that require usb, and all i have to do is disconnect it from one computer and plug it into the other and everything Works great. As far as small flash drives that require external power i have no idea.  hope some reviewer will elaborate on that.  In any case its well worth the money.  It stays forever lit, and thats okay.  It will look funny 10 years from now when the lights are extinguished. This usb port is sleek and functional. It is plug and play. It even come with its own power supply in case you have power hungry peripherals. Even though it works fine for me without its own power supply I chose to use it as recommended by the manufacturer. It comes with a lifetime warranty. I have a CyperPower UPS that has been very reliable and I expect this little Cyber wonder to be nothing less. Dish allows external USB HDs to be connected to all compatible units to expand allowable disk space. You can even use external USB drives with non-DVR Dish receivers to add DVR capabilities. My 750GB HD is full so I needed a solution for adding more and making it as painless as possible to change between them because the Dish receivers only recognize one external HD at a time when multiple HDs are connected. I added a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Western-Digital-My-Book-Essential-1-TB-USB-2-0-Desktop-External-Hard-Drive-WDH1U10000N/dp/B000VZCEUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Western Digital My Book Essential 1 TB USB 2.0 Desktop External Hard Drive WDH1U10000N</a>&nbsp;and am using this hub along with a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/American-DJ-PC-100A-8-Channel-Power-Strip-with-Lighted-Toggles/dp/B0002GL50Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">American DJ PC-100A 8 Channel Power Strip with Lighted Toggles</a>&nbsp;to turn on the drive I am using and power down the one(s) I am not. This set up leaves me room to add more HDs in the future. Works great!\n",
      "\n",
      "NOTE: Last night, I accidently turned the power off to the hub and the Dish DVR still saw the USB HD. So, you may be able to use this without the power source. I use this hub with my Mac and it is great. I just plugged into my USB port on my MacBook Pro and have never had a problem with it. You can optionally power the device with the included AC Adapter, which lights up a bunch of green lights and one brilliant blue light at the top of the green lights. This blue light is extremely bright for its size and may need to be covered if you are sleeping in the same room with it. I have plenty of open slots for additional devices. If you are using this device vertically in the stand there is a front USB slot for you to attach your flash drive without any effort. Everything (at least with a Mac) is recognized and ready to go once it is plugged in. I would highly recommend this hub - you can't find anything as nice for the price that is powered. This is an excelent USB port it has the option for it's power . Ether pluged in an A/C outlet or power from your device's nice option This little guy is really small but I think that's one of the best characteristics.  No problems with the device.  Machine recognized it immediately.  I would buy this item again if I needed one. Great hub.  it's a plug in, which is actually a plus because it came power larger items too.  I have not had any dead usb ports. I really like this hub.  I have an Acer One Netbook, and I use this hub to power my cd/dvd external drive, my laptop cooler pad, and my 1tb external hard drive.  My cooler pad also has a few usb ports, and I have a 4-in-1 memory card reader plugged into that.  Everything works fine.  Sometimes I have to unplug my cd/dvd drive to get the netbook to read it properly.  I had that same problem with another hub though, so I think it's the drive.  It works more often with this hub than with my other though.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is very small.  The main picture makes it look huge, but it's really palm sized. I took it with me on vacation, and it fit just fine in the carry-on.  You don't need to keep the stand on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also like the one port in the front for when I need to plug in a usb drive. I replaced a four port USB powered hub with this one and it worked flawlessly right out of the box.  I'm using every port with two hard drives, a mouse, a printer, Lightdrive DVD burner, a Canon USB powered scanner and a camera. Saves a lot of time and trouble not having to unplug one accessory to make room for another.

After researching a bit, I bought the CyberPower one and now the keyboard works fine.  In fact, lots of other usb things now work without being plugged directly into the computer.  I'm quite happy with it. The one other reviewer was right on when they said this unit is much smaller than the photos make it look. I was a little worried this was a bit large for my desk area. It ISN'T large at all, see the pix I posted.\n",
      "Unit works great and I am pleased.  Some small nitpicky things are: The power brick is kinda big, the LED is really bright, and you do not use the normal A--B USB cord to connect the hub to the PC... you use an A--MiniUSB cord. Not a big deal, but I have lots of 8ft AB cords but no long A--Mini.  The 5' cord that comes with it is too short for me. Thanks for reading. i have use this product for 6 months it does a great job, the dlink i used on another system kept losing connection in the middle of transfers i threw it away, this one works.\n",
      "\n",
      "i use lots of usb devices and i have TWO of these on ONE computer and they work fantastic.  when i copy movies to my personal video player from my network hard drives these never fail.  the other ones would stop sending packets in the middle of a trasfer. i have 2 printers, 2 scanners, video capture, mouse, and keyboard, tv, external hard drives, 2 flash card readers, docking for sandisk mpeg player, docking for ipod player, external game system for updating firmware, wacom drawing board for adobe cs3, and other attachments i hook on and off.  these hubs always works.\n",

      "downside, ive had to learn the tricks of windows xp on keeping track of drive letters and changing them around, there are third party programs that i have tried but i'd rather use disk manager and do it myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "you will need to do a little cable management because the unit is small and the volume of cables attached to it can physically push it around, but some cable ties or electrical take easily takes care of the problem. Great product.  I like that I can set it upright and move it anywhere on my desk - out of the way. [Apart from minor issues like stability of the \"weighted\" base, this hub has been such a consistent, heavy-duty performer, while holding its price point (just short of 30) for exactly 4 years, that I've had to award it 5 stars (and order the identical model for my wife).  But just in the last 2 months the hub has been behaving completely opposite to expectations.  It goes totally dead with my hard drives, telling me that they're drawing too much power and therefore the hub is shutting them down until I remove them. But even when the hub is naked with the exception of a tiny flash drive, it remains dead, dark and non-communicative.  It comes back to life only when I disconnect the AC power and rely on nothing more than the power supplied by the USB ports.  That's fine, but not what I need with my 1TB (and bigger) hard drives, which until now had been showing on my computer's desktop with each start-up.  I'm about to call a rep in order to get an idea of what's going on and whether there's a fix (could it be Apple's latest update to OSX?  I'll be back pending further info.]\n",
      "\n",
      "I realized I needed a 7-port hub and checked out the D-Link, Kensington, Belkin--the usual suspects.  Then I chanced upon this unlikely contender, looking more like a jukebox in Amazon's picture than a hub.  I was intrigued by the off-beat design and noticed that the price was competitive (though a couple of the others are presently offering rebates, a free flylight, and other sweeteners). Now that I'm looking at the CyberPower USB port \"in person,\" I can provide a few initial impressions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  It's a lot smaller than the picture might imply.  Compactness is nice, but you also want a hub that will stay put and that allows sufficient space between adjacent plugs.\n",
      "2.  Although the hub is designed for either vertical or horizontal use, the added and welcome weight of the detachable base makes vertical use the more sensible option.  Otherwise, you've got a lightweight (and fairly generic) loaded-up plug which could easily move around, dislodging the USB mini-plug (a necessary evil except for small cameras) at one end of every USB 2.0 cable.\n",
      "3.  It seems to handle my equipment off of the USB power supplied by the computer, but I still breathe easier using the included AC power adapter. (To the manufacturer's credit, it's one of the slimmer, lighter wall-warts that I've seen.)\n",
      "4.  The flash drive mount is practical (but not unique).  Now I can finally use that old Sandisk thumb drive that formerly was taking up the space of two USB ports.\n",
      "5.  The individual port lights are on all the time and, unlike most hubs, are not indicative of the presence or absence of a USB device.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, it's a reliable performer and a convenient as well as eye-catching device--providing you go for the vertical look.  If I were to suggest one design improvement, it would be to \"fatten up\" the tower so that it would be wide enough to permit horizontal insertion of USB devices with the hub in vertical position.  Doing so would assure unforced accommodation of all your USB plugs, even the most space-devouring ones.  Biggest \"gripe\": the vertical design is not real stable.  The hub is easily dislodged from the base and bounces around quite a bit.  If I had to do it over, I'd look at the heavy, dome-shaped Kensington.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Revaluation after almost 3 years: I tried the Kensington. It was no more stable but less reliable. So I returned to the CyberPower, but without the base or vertical position.  I velcroed its back side to the wooden surface behind my desktop machine, with printer and two 500GB storage drives inputted to the rear, one USB cable from the front side to the USB of my iMac, and a flash drive connected to the top side of the hub.  Absolutely no problems.  This item continues to rise in both popularity and price because it's so good.  Should it ever fail, I doubt there's any other hub available that could surpass it. Forget the \"cuteness\" factor; this thing is all business.]\n",
      "\n",
      "[4 years later: This \"off brand\" hub continues to be an Amazon best-seller while hubs like the Kensington \"round mound\" have fallen off the map, so this one is a proven winner.  Only lately I've had some difficulty with getting it to recognize really large (1TB) hard drives. Before condemning the drive, I going to try some different cables and maybe a call to the manufacturer.  Otherwise, the next step up would be either a 3.0 USB hub or a hub with dedicated switches, permitting you to assign just the power-draining devices to the AC-powered inputs while allowing the other devices (iPods, mouse receivers, flash drives, printers, etc.) to run sheerly on USB power.] Problem:\n",

      "It seems there's always something else to plug in to a USB port on my laptop, but I've long since run out of ports for plugging.  In desperation, I bought a 4-port hub (working just fine, thank you), but I still did not have enough ports to do the job.  And the idea of daisy-chaining was not practical because my desk is already overloaded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solution:\n",
      "\n",
      "Enter the CyberPower 7-port hub.  Space-saving solution to running out of ports.  And, with its own power supply, it's not draining power from my laptop.  Works like a charm!\n",
      "\n",
      "I did find the glow light annoying, but it's easy enough to unplug the hub when I finish working in the evening, so it's not a big issue for me.\n",

      "\n",
      "This little tool solves that problem and also ensures that I am able to safely push food stuff into the garbage disposal without accidentally trimming my nails or fingers.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a simple plastic insert that can stay in place in the garbage disposal opening when not being used. When in place, It's raised up just enough to allow water to drain easily. But when you do need to use it to push food into the disposal, just pick it up using the permanently attached handle and it's ready to jump into action.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing that may bother some people is that the handle is fixed and will always be sticking up about an inch... it does not fold down. That doesn't bother me in the least.\n",

      "It might be nice if this came in a few more colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do like that it can be cleaned easily by tossing it in the dishwasher.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think this should be included with all garbage disposal purchases. It's just great. Great product it does the job I bought this to replace a big bulky tool that I have had for years.  The first thing I did was open and try it out.  This works better than what I had.  I totally can not wait to use this again.  I  will be purchasing more of these for family members. works as it should/ saves your silverware Works exactly as it should - charges the TX but it does not have a sync button.\n",
      "Syncing has to be done by opening up the Hotsync application so it is not really a problem - just not as convenient as having the button to press for syncing that is incorporated with the original USB lead. Purchase was delivered as promised, was as described, the price was reasonable and it works as advertised.  What else can you ask for?  If all purchases were this easy and simple, life would be a lot more pleasant. It was nice to find one of these online that was new. I am happy with this as a direct replacement. @doatactical I've previously owned a multitude of headsets, but let me tell you I was missing out until I bought a Jabra.\n",
      "\n",
      "I always thought the \"in the ear\" bud and bulky-looking design would be uncomfortable, but it was not.  Frankly it is the the most comfortable headset I have ever worn, and I've worn dozens.  I truly forget it is on my head.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for sound quality, everything I hear is clear, with ample volume available.  People I speak to report equally clear sound without much, if any background noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Battery life is great and range is sufficient for me to put my smartphone on the cradle and walk around the house or the office without any signal loss or crackling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something else I liked was the belt clip.  So many headsets overlook the fact that you have nowhere to put your earpiece when you're not using it.  The belt clip is small, just big enough to actually hold the headset, and tucks in right behind the clip for my phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're not a clip-loving person, the whole headset has an almost flat profile so it fits nicely in a pocket.  Other headsets, especially those with flip-out mics feel awfully bulbous in a pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "One last little \"Gee Whiz\" feature- the vibro-alert.  Since I want my phone on the charge/sync cradle whenever possible, this feature really excites me.  Instead of being required to actually wear the headset at all times to avoid missing a call when the phone is in the other room, this headset has a vibrate feature to notify me of an incoming call.  I call this a \"gee whiz\" feature because I never knew I needed it until I had it!\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, there are an awful lot of headsets out there.  All of the designs and features can be confusing, but you can rest assured knowing that this headset has everything you need (and some things you may not!) and does so at a very reasonable price. This is the best bluetooth device I've tried.  It is lightweight, comfortable, easy to set-up, good sound clarity and it is a very well made and sturdy device.  There aren't flimsy parts that can break.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best thing is that the ear peace is fairly inconspicuous as it sits over your ear.  I really don't want to look like Janet Jackson in her Control video as I walk around town or the mall.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is in finding replacement ear gels.  They are not available on the Jabra site or on any other site.  I ended up back at Cingular (now AT & T) and they gave me a couple that they had in a drawer. I have some friends who use this headset with their Motorola phones and it worked great, so i decided to get one.... Unfortunately the VX-8100's Bluetooth doesn't work very good. I have to hold the phone a few inches from my head to be able to hear what people are saying, otherwise there's too much static. I might as well just flip the phone open and not use the headset. I have since tried a couple of other Bluetooth headsets and found the static problem with all of them. The headset works great on other phones, I tried it on a friends 8300 and it worked flawlessly.\n",
      "If you need a good Bluetooth headset this one is great just make sure your phone's Bluetooth isn't [...] This headphone fits well on my ear, has very good sound, no noise, great range, easy to use and good battery life. After researching and trying different ones - some were more expensive - I realized this was even better value for money. Excellent Product!!! After trying the Motorola HS 810 which would feel like it was always falling off or falling off, I tried several Bluetooth headsets at the Sprint and Cingular stores. Other than the Jabra, they were all the same, they had a loop that you hook onto your ear, so they did not fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the only one headset that would properly wrap around my ear and because the ear piece goes into the ear canal, stay anchored. Sound quality is great. The HS 810 would not hold a charge very long. So far so good with this Jabra --- it holds a charge while the Motorola needed to be charged all of the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like the vibrating feature when the phone ringer is turned off --- no need to share all that noise. As I am on call or expecting calls often when I am out at dinner, this really makes it discreet rather than missing the call and playing telephone tag for awhile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sound quality is better than the Motorola HS 810. Jabra seems to work well for those who have small ears and their ear cells make it adjustable.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you don't need the vibrating feature, try the new Jabra BT 500 which is an upgrade of the Jabra BT 250, charging can be USB cable which is great as you will not have to take another charger on the trip!\n",
      "\n",
      "I also have the Jabra SP500 which is a wireless speakerphone and it works great vs. the Motorola speakerphone which I returned. The Speakerphone power and power AC cords for the BT 250v are not compatible, so if you need to use both, you will need two charges, although they are small. After having replaced my 250 3 times at the verizon store I asked to be given the 250V instead of a 4th 250, they did and so far so good, I think Jabra knew the 250 had some defects , each 250 i had died (stopped pairing) in about 2 months, the 250V seems to have no problems and works much better with my Motorola V710.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fit is great, and the sound is good, could use better noise cancellation, but oh well, maybe in a future model. But overall , I like the 250V. I recommend it to anyone. Just roll your windows up if your driving, or you won't be heard by the other end of your call. Excellet Works great, well made.  Great bargin on amazon. works good, good sound quality, easy to use. The unit works great.  It does NOT cancel out background noise very well, but, is very comfortable. Good! I have had these in the past, lost the last one. Works great, I would recommend, wife like the smaller one though. worked great with my nokia phone for a very long time.  great sound quality and probably competitive with more modern headsets if I still had it.  After a long time with a lot of use, i broke it.  would definitely recommend. The HS850 is larger than the H700 series and does not have a USB charger.  Other than that, it seems to work fine. I was stunned. After 2 plantronics (a 320 and a 330) I was tired of earhooks that came loose and dropped calls. I thought it was my provider when my calls got dropped consistently in the same areas on my drive to/from work. But this headset is phenomenal! maybe one dropped call in a week... And the off/on operation is great! Open/close the boom to turn off/on! I love this headset... and I don't say that often IMHO this is slightly better than the Moto H700.  It's larger, and a bit heavier.  The boom is larger.  But if that's not an issue, then both are equal IMHO.  Both have the cheek problem!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now for the problem where people cannot hear you, or you sound muffled or away from the phone.  Wearing your bluetooth, look in the mirror and see how the boom touches your cheek or if you have a beard it'll touch that.  Note there is a very small hole on the inside of the boom that gets the sound.  Now anything that touches that will impede your voice....it's like putting a towel over a regular phone and talking to someone. Not you do not need puffy cheeks for this problem to happen.  Unless you have a very narrow face, chances are this will happen to you and you'll blame it on the bluetooth!\n",
      "\n",
      "TO fix this, get either Neoprene tubing or that sticky foam on one end (mole skin) and cut a small piece and put on the hinge near the boom then a smaller piece (if needed) on top of the other.  This will make a space between your cheek and the boom so people can hear you! With this fix, you will still be able to close your boom. As long as you use this with a treo great reliability. Use a Blackberry Perl horrible! But fast delivery great value! I LOVE this blue tooth. The boom mic that swings up out of the way, also turns it off and on. No more holding the button down just the right way for just the right length of time to turn it on! The ear piece also folds down which makes it easy to get on in the \"mid\" position. Very comfortable. Headset is light and I have actually forgotten I have it on. Fits well with my glasses ear piece also. Reversible for either ear. It will recognize the phone up to 30 ft away...I tried it! Crystal clear sound on both ends. Even when driving! Battery power (length of charge) is awesome. I've had it on for 2 days straight and it still had a full charge. Charges up fast also with the included charger. I've had other bluetooth devices and this is my absolute favorite. Price is right also. I wonder how many of these bad reviews are results of fake products purchased off Ebay.  I had a hs820 and a hs850 that I thought were poor performers until I tried a genuine Motorola product.  I could not believe the difference in performance and just how good the fakes looked.  Just watch out, if it is from China or Hong Kong leave it alone...no matter the price. This product is light, easy to use and very comfortable. Before I bought this product, I did a research of my own and ask for suggestions. This item was recommended the most. I am happy with this product and I would definitely recommend it to my friends and my family. It is ultra-easy to use, works great.  I get plenty of volume, folks hear me great and that's that. I have Sony Ericsson W600i/S710 and HS850 works great. What we love  is folding boom, which saves lot of cell phone battery (fold it and turns off) When you get call just open boom and you are talking on headset. Voice quality is great in car (windows down) no background noise. It is best compare to Motorola HS801, HS820 and Tekkeon headsets we used in past. We just love how it is easy to turn headset off to save battery life of both devices. If you have problem with voice or connectivity you check your cell phone conversation volume (just press volume key when you are talking with someone to increase conversation volume just another way..) This is the 2nd HS850 I own. I always kept the first one I owned in the car and decided I wanted to keep one in the house also.  So I bought the H700 (the newer, smaller unit from Motorola).  I figured since I liked my HS850, I would \"upgrade\" to the H700.  What a mistake!!  I gave that one away and bought myself a 2nd HS850.  I find this unit is so much more comfotable and just works so much nicer than the newer version.  Bottom line, I own 2 of these and LOVE them both. I have been very happy with this headset.  I use it with a Motorola RAZR V3.\n",
      "\n",
      "My last Bluetooth headset was a Jabra, and it broke after just a few months -- the power button quit working, so it was always on until the battery drained.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love the HS850 since it has no power button!  Instead, you just flip it open or closed.  It gets great battery life, since it's so easy to put it in standby by flipping it closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have also used this headset successfully with Skype on both Windows and Mac.  The only catch is that it can only be active with one device at a time, so you have to disconnect/release it from your cell phone, before you can successfully use it with Windows or Mac.  This makes switching back and forth between your PC and phone a bit cumbersome.  Of course, it took a couple of hours to get it working under Windows, but it worked first try on the Mac ;-) I was one of the lucky few to get one of these free for registering my Motorola MPX-220.  I was skeptical to the whole bluetooth scene, but this headset quickly changed my mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "The device will easily last 3-4 days in standby mode with average usage.  The sound is excellent, and people who listen think I'm talking on a normal phone.  The range is great.  I can be about 50 feet away without a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best part about the phone is the intuitive on/off.  When the microphone boom is \"folded\" out, it turns on.  Fold it back in, and it turns off.  Simple, yes.  But many other headsets require you to push buttons (or hold them down).  This makes using it a snap!\n",
      "\n",
      "I actually have one for my home office and another that I leave in my car. I have a Siemens SX66 (yes, the PDA-phone that supposedly works with no Bluetooth headset out there), and I'm very happy with this headset.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's reasonably comfortable, has great sound volume, even in noisy environments, people say I sound clear even when in an automobile while driving, and it synchronized right away with the SX66.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most importantly, with the boom mic to flip, you can turn this unit on and off in a fraction of a second.  My SX66 recognizes the HS850 headset within a second (I'm at the latest Bluetooth v1.1 driver from Siemens/Microsoft - I tried applying the patch from Siemens' website, but the phone was already at the latest version).\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, everything works well, and the ambient noise cancellation features seem to work well, according to the people I'm talking to.\n",
      "\n",
      "I haven't run this to the point it has completely lost power - I don't know how long it lasts.  At least 3-4 days of idle and 4-5 hours of talk time. One of the first high quality Bluetooths made - still one of the best, IMHO All I wanted was a simple hands-free ... this one includes a button on the mic that answers (short click) and hangs up (hold for a couple of seconds) ... AND it also enables voice control (be sure to turn key lock delay OFF on your phone) ... I can dial by name, by number, check voicemail -- all from the headset. And ... btw, ear volume is great (I had to dial mine DOWN), unless I am just accustomed to junk. Finally, the thing is a little floppy in the ear ... but no worse than any other I have ever used. Phone is v3xx. This wired Motorola RAZR headset is better than a Bluetooth one for these reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "-the mic is closer to your mouth so your voice will sound better and clearer than a Bluetooth headset where the mic is way up by your ear. I tried a wireless Bluetooth headset and my voice always sounded distant and callers could hear ambient room noise around me. They said I sounded like I was using a speakerphone. But when I use this wired headset, they say my voice is quite clear and loud.\n",
      "\n",
      "-it's easier to just plug in this wired headset at any time than fool around with the settings for syncing with the Bluetooth when you want to by on headset.\n",
      "\n",
      "-This headset is easier to carry with you than a Bluetooth one and no AC adapater charger or battery is required.\n",
      "\n",
      "-This headset is cheaper than a Bluetooth headset and in fact comes bundled with some RAZR phones.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only reason I'm not rating this headset 5 stars is that I agree with other reviews, the earpiece doesn't fit that snuggly in the ear. This is a minor complaint for me though as the headset does pretty much what I want it to do and it does it nicely. Fits the Motorola Razr V3 like it was specifically designed for it. The elastic top allows you to use the flip functionality of your phone unlike other leather covers that prohibit your phone from closing all the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perfect. Perfect slim close fitting case and is well worth the money. The razr remains very thin since this case is wellcrafted. No bulk here and extremely stylish. Krusell makes the best cell phone cases in the world. The craftmenship of this product is great. I have two family members who love this case for their RAZR'S. I just bought a RAZR and I ordered this case as well. You can't find a better case out there.\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree with the others about the pro's of the case. I really don't see any con's. I mean, how slim do you expect the phone to be with *any* case? Be realistic. :)\n",
      "\n",
      "A++ Krusell is a well known manufacturer for quality and perfect fit. This is no exception. I own a Krusell brand case for my Dell Axim and recently purchased this one for my Razr.\n",
      "Craftsmanship is excellent, stitches are very well aligned as well as opening for USB connection. It fits perfectly on my Razr. I looked at all available Razr cases before I bought this and realized I made a good decision. This is actually a quad-band mobile phone which makes it a true 'world phone'... more so than the common tri-band devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "World phones are generally equipped w/ both 1900 and 1800 frequencies. Together, these frequencies cover Europe, much of the U.S. and many other countries. Most tri-band units, however, are usually equipped with either 850 or 900mhz.\n",
      "\n",
      "850 fills in the 'rural gaps' in The States. 900 allows for roaming in New Zealand and Australia. Whereas both T-Mobile and Cingular operate on GSM frequencies and therefore can offer world phones, Cingular operates on the 850 and T-Mobile on 900. They allow each other to use their frequencies for instances where they don't provide a needed frequency... provided you device is equipped w/ both 850 & 900 mhz as is the Motorola V330.\n",
      "\n",
      "How is T-Mobile? Truth of the matter (as with any mobile phone service) it comes down to the region you live in as well as what building your in and the area that building is in. Sorry, there is no across-the-board answer. As soon as one gets great reception, his/her neighbor curses it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Visually, this phone is indistinguishable from just another flip phone, but it offers rather large and well-spaced keys. The screen is vivid and bright. The ringtone gets plenty loud. For these reasons, it's a great phone for seniors who still want a modern phone. I just got one for my mum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, being a quad-band, video, camera, multi-zoom, bluetooth, infrared device w/ browser, the general ease of operation can only be so easy. That 'said,' many a senior probably couldn't be bothered w/ messing with it all or putting to test call quality in rural U.S. and New Zealand.\n",
      "\n",
      "That you get all of this and at such a price makes the V330 an eyebrow-raising steal.\n",

      "\n",
      "A quality phone packed w/ a host of goodies. Go 'head on, Motorola. [...]\n",
      "On to the instrument now. This phone has the following pros and cons (IMHO):\n",
      "\n",
      "PROS:\n",
      "------\n",
      "1.  Bluetooth: Amazing feature which allows you to download all the pictures and videos from the phone apart from ofcourse the hands-free option. The bluetooth features included are File Transfer, Dial-up Networking etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  Speakerphone: The speaker on this phone is of a real good quality. Of course the quality also depends on the signal strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  External Display: Well light for digital time display, signal strength, battery life and bluetooth indicator. How much more can we ask of an external display?\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  Keypad: Well organized, decent color schemes, ergonomically designed and everything in its place. Some people whine about the T-Mobile logo but its no bother for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  Software: I have always liked the software on motorola phones. Good amount of choice in ringtones, wallpapers, screensavers with download options too. The networking and connectivity is great and office tools (calendar, calculator etc.) live upto expectations. The only flaw in the phone book (as one reviewer pointed out) is the lack of categories (home, work, mobile etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "CONS:\n",
      "------\n",
      "1. Dimensions: It is a bulky phone which requires a belt clip if you want to save yourself the embarassment of a bulb shaped pocket. If you don't want to wear a clip I'd suggest the RAZR for a few $$$ more.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  Weight: It is certainly one of the heavier phones in the market. So if you are moving from a lighter instrument you might want to consider this issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  Display: The display screen has the magical powers of going black when the display light goes out (default is 20sec but I had to set it to 60sec to work with bluetooth). Ofcourse by pressing any key it will get back on.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  Antenna: Considering the fact that this phone is heavy and bulky the MOT guys could have shown some mercy on the size of the antenna. It could have been more like the antenna you would find on a T722i.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  Camera: It's not the best resolution but would work if you are not looking to make a photography career by using the camera on this phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been researching cell phones for 2 months now. If you are looking for a decent flip-camera phone which won't cost you very much but has the latest features (bluetooth, speakerphone) for a 1 yr contract ... go for the V330. I have had a Treo 650 for about two years now.  I am a cell phone junkie and like to have the newest technology but I love this phone so much I won't even think of getting something else.  I won't even \"upgrade\" to a newer Treo.  As a matter of fact the one I have in use now is my second.  I bought the first one used on the internet to test it out and the second new.  It reboots from time to time but only if I have the text message notification and try to delete messages with out clearing the notifications.  Not a big deal at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have downloaded Ringo so I can use MP3's for ringers which was my biggest gripe of all.\n",
      "\n",
      "The camera takes ok pictures but I am not expecting professional quality from my phone.  Just a snapshot to remember the moment.  If you really want good pictures take your camera for pete's sake. First off, I enjoy buying and switching cell phones and PDAs and trying out all the features, nit-picking their deficits, and praising their perfections...it's become a hobby, somewhat, and to date I have not found the perfect one of either (although Nokia phones are close).\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, I'm a bit obsessive-compulsive when it comes to planning, organizing, etc. and for 8 years I have not been able to let go of using paper planners rather than switching over to a PDA. I decided to switch over this year since as a new nurse, I don't trust to carry much to work, especially an organizer spilling over with post-it notes. As for phone usage, I am not a power user but I do use it several times a day in short conversations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Palm Treo 650 has been awesome, better than I expected, and is not making it very difficult for me to let go of paper and pen. What struck me first was the gorgeous screen (it's something like 65,000), which is bright  and vibrant (compared to the Tungsten I have had). There's a plethora of features to learn but that's part of the fun, isn't it? I got this phone unlocked so I use it on T-Mobile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I am not a business professional, I cannot speak for the functionality from that perspective but as young professional who loves to text message, constantly check email (I got Gmail POP to work in 2 minutes flat), use the phone, and obsessive-compulsively check daily plans, weekly timetables, etc. as well as write several notes-to-self, to-do lists, and shopping lists, this Treo is awesome. It also doesn't hurt that it looks terrifically sophisticated, albeit bulky, which I actually like (it doesn't feel so dainty like the Motorola Q and Samsung Blackjack). And I personally like the antenna on top, unlike the more recent Treo models.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have not had the issue that others have had of the phone switching on and off or freezing and so far the applications have been running seamlessly. As there as tons of things to find out about this Treo, I will just conclude with the highlights of the good and bad that I've found:\n",
      "\n",
      "GOOD:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Good look, good feel (just get a case or sleeve so it stays shiny and new).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Screen and colors are beautiful.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Call quality is good and clear, no issues with volume.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Organizer is excellent and easy to learn/use.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Camera phone is good for a VGA cam, just make sure to get a larger capacity SD memory card.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Battery life is good (I charge it every 2-3 days)\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Versamail retreives my Gmail with no problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Internet, although not 3G or Wifi, will suffice!\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Any extra applications or help you need is probably already on the internet.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Bluetooth syncs well with my Mac's Bluetooth, transferring pictures and songs is soo easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Lots of customizing options.\n",
      "\n",
      "NOT SO GOOD:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Wish Palm would come out with a different, more detailed \"Month View,\" rather than those colored boxes/blocks representing your events.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Wish the camera could have been a 1.3mp camera or higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Keypad is still kind of cramped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this Treo 650 has been good to me. It's fun to use, although I can't tell you how it holds up as a heavy-duty business phone. Hope this helps others in the same boat! Especially those who have had a hard time deciding whether to make the switch from paper planning to a PDA. It's been two weeks with my Treo 650 and now I remember why I love the Palm OS so much. I switched to BlackBerry two years ago (7290) and I've enjoyed using it except for the very, very basic screen. I assume that's how they get such remarkable battery life. But, I've had to switch from the BB for work reasons and I'm very happily using Palm again. My last Palm was a Palm Vx and it's still alive and kicking after many, many years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Treo 650's screen is really amazing. And, I've read the older reviews about the Treo 650 and the frequent resetting issue. I was certainly concerned and ready to send it back if I had problems (Cingular gives you 30 days to try it out). So far only one reset in two weeks with the Palm - honestly, I had to reset the BlackBerry constantly so I'm not sure I'd notice the difference. And, the BB resets are particularly annoying because they would happen at the start of answering incoming calls and then literally take 5-8 minutes to reset and let me use it again. I'm not sure why it took so long - I did have a big address book. The Palm reset only took 30 seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, here's where Treo shines: screen graphics, photos, mp3s and videos. I can put 2-4 movies on a 2GB SD card, pop into the Palm and carry around some convenient entertainment. One little feature that really impressed me was the ability to display the screen vertically (it's longer that way). With letterbox movies it really increases the size of the video and exceeds the size of videos on my Zen Vision 30GB screen. And, the videos really look incredible.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, of course, there's a ton of free software out there for the Palm. So far, I've only downloaded TCPMP for the movies. The included RealPlayer is very impressive - you're ready to listen to mp3s right out of the box.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final note: I've used the Palm Desktop for PIM stuff (contacts, calendar, to do's) off and on for years and I'm still impressed with it's features and easy/quick navigation. They've always been ahead of the pack - I know many of the newer phones come with similar PIM software so your PC can talk to your new phone but aside from BlackBerry no one else is even in the ballpark.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can manage photos in there as well and even add photos to your address book so once you've synced up your incoming calls display a picture of the caller. I know this has been around for a while but it wasn't available on my old Palm V or the new BlackBerry I've been using for the past few years. I have been itching for a Treo ever since the 600 came out and I noticed that more streamlined design.  When smartphones were first introduced, I bucked the trend of combining the two thinking that as often as I use my cell phone and my pda, if I bought one that integrated both I would wear it out twice as fast.  And in my humble opinion, it was a valid reason because back then, the original phone/pda's were impossibly large.  Well I have finally become a convert.\n",
      "\n",
      "I spent a great deal of time researching Blackberry's vs. the Treo's vs. Pocket PC's and came VERY close to grabbing a T-Mobile Dash (which I still believe is the all-around smallest model availabe as I write this, or at least it SEEMED to be), but I finally settled with the trusted Palm OS platform (one that I have become VERY familiar with over the years using pda's for quite some time now).  When I set out to get one, I really had my heart set on the Treo 680...but as I read the reviews for them, one thing kept creeping in to almost all the reviews: battery life was terrible.  With that aside, quite a few of the reviewers mentioned that all things considered, they were more happy with their old 650.  I saw this on so MANY reviews that I began to think twice.  Then I noticed that the 700p was a more beefed up version of the 650, and began to consider it as well.  Unfortunately as I write this, it isn't available with Alltell service where I am (it will, but nobody can give me a target date, and dang it, I am too impatient to wait...) so I am right back with the 650.  It took a while before Palm was able to knock enough of the bugs out of the 650 that I felt like buying one would be worth it...and I am discovering more than a few bugs have been associated with both the 680 & 700p, so no matter HOW much time I spend considering upgrading to a newer model, I find compelling reasons to go right back to the Old School 650.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason #1 to go with it: Since it is no longer available at Palm's Official website, and with the newer models coming out, chances are you can find some pretty sweet deals on the older 650.\n",
      "Reason #2: Virtually ALL of the problems originally associated with the 650 have been eliminated.  You want Push email?  You can get it.  You want web surfing?  No prob.  You want to view AND edit MS Word Documents and Excell?  Easier than ever with the 650 (that was one major plus over most of the Pocket PC's and ALL of the Blackberrys -- sure you can VIEW some of these documents, but you cannot EDIT them, too).\n",
      "Reason #3: No matter HOW convenient the pda, I found it next to impossible to give up a touch-screen's amazing versatility and the ease with which you can use it to edit things and connect on websites.\n",
      "\n",
      "One more important item to factor in when considering buying a 650: With the popularity with ever increasing wireless downloading speeds, I was afraid that the slower Treo would make internet surfing next to impossible because of the archaic speeds with which you are forced to endure.  I was VERY pleastantly surprised that downloading web pages did not take as long as I was at first expecting.  I have to tell you, after experimenting with the supposedly MUCH faster 700p with another online carrier than the one I was using (I won't say which, but they really did their best to tell me the 650 was slower than a dial-up modem from 1985), anyway, the 650 was only SLIGHTLY slower than this screaming fast 700p or the 700w.  I figured that was something I could live with to be honest.  Hey, it's a tiny hand-held device that allows me to send and receive email and surf the web...I'm still amazed that something like this exists at ALL to be honest with you...so downloading speed is still secondary in my opinion.  If speed really IS on your list of absolutes, maybe you ought to move up to something else...but keep in mind, it is only BARELY faster than what I experienced first hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "One more thing: the screen is amazing.  There are only so many ways to say WOW.  If you are considering buying a Palm that runs Windows Mobile, you ought to know that the screen clarity is almost reduced by HALF.  This apparently has something to do with Window's OS, and seriously put my decision to buy one on the back burner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure there are things that a smartphone cannot as yet do without some difficulty or impossibility...but that is the same with ALL current models.  Do some SERIOUS research into what you want vs. what you NEED and make an informed decision only AFTER you have had the chance to go into a store and test a specific model PERSONALLY.  Do that and no matter WHAT you decide on, you will most likely be happy.  So far, I know I am VERY satisfied with my choice.  Good luck on yours.\n",
      "\n",
      "***UPDATE***\n",
      "\n",
      "I opted not to get a Bluetooth hands-free device -- at first.  Originally I would see people walking around with these Lt. Uhura type thingy's sticking out of their ears and I couldn't help but wonder how lazy people are that they cannot raise their hand up to their head while walking around simply to talk on the phone.  For the most part I STILL feel this way, but I decided to buy a Bluetooth hands-free headset for while I am driving.  I cannot afford to miss calls, and being in radio, when not at work or home I can be found in my car monitoring the radio virtually 100% of the time and unfortunately this means I sometimes cannot hear the ringer.  The tethered device that came with the phone is certainly loud enough, but simply did not fit my ear (it kept falling out).  I bought a replacement that came with a variable size adapter and yet while it FIT better, the sound was almost impossible to hear (the worst I have ever experienced, actually).  So I took the plunge knowing full-well that the Palm Treo has a somewhat problematic history using these devices...so I made sure that I had an iron-clad return policy in place and jumped in.  It took me no more than a minute to configure my head-set and I went ahead and made a test call which had more than enough volume -- in fact it had plenty to spare.  All in all I am VERY satisfied with the performance. (I bought a Keycera Bluetooth, if that means anything)\n",
      "\n",
      "One additional item that requires mentioning: I currently have call-waiting as a service with my Treo and yet I have missed at least 3 calls (that I know of).  This particular feature does not seem to be supported by the 650...and IF it is, I have yet to discover any useful info regarding the problem, whether online or in the bible-sized instruction manual.  I will keep looking and IF I find a solution I will quickly report it here asap.  Just one more thing to think about.  Otherwise, I am amazingly satisfied with my Treo otherwise.  The ONLY thing I wish (other than user-friendly call-waiting) is faster downloads while online.  That is supposedly possible with the newer models using EVDO and yet the 700p I tested failed to work only slightly faster than my 650.  Maybe it was the network -- but not according to them (no surprise there).  I still think my purchase was WELL worth it. As someone who used the original Palm Pilot and eventually the Handspring Visor with Visor phone, I thought off and on about buying the Treo 650. The very mixed, sometimes extreme, reviews of the 650 and the relatively high price for an unlocked Treo kept me away. With the release of the next generation of Treos drmatically forcing down the price of the 650 I decided to take a chance. After a week of fairly active use I have to say that I am extremely pleased with my new Treo. I bought my new unlocked (Cingular branded) Treo online. The phone clarity is as good as any mobile phone that I have owned. I have not had any dropped calls. The browswer and e-mail client that came loaded on my Treo work well. I live in a country where the fastest mobile data connection is still GPRS/EDGE, so my Tro 650 is just right. I easily synced my Treo with my MacBook with no problems. Over all for $225 + shipping and handling of $20 I have to say that this was a real bargain. This is exciting stuff... wooo hooo. I plug the new 3G SIM card in my new Blackberry Bold and yes it works. :) Good product great then! Worked great. sim card 100 good As described. Great! k AT&T Single SIM Card UMTS 3G UICC-B Product was exactly what I needed.  Excellent Works as expected I purchased this item a while back, but I remember that it was great item.  I would definitely recommend it. The 3 G sim card worked well without any problem. I would recommend to anyone who would like to activate a phone They send you a whole credit card sized piece of plastic with this. It's like when there is christmas and the kids only want to play with the box. Yeah, somehow it's exactly like that. Good customer service. never any issues. great about upgrades. Simple and Easy to get and new phone mailed and have simple instructions on how to setup your new phone. Fulfilled all my expectations. Easy activation and AT&T 3G SIM internet is great. No complaints at all. A must have if traveling to the U.S. This was a lovely purchase the gift went over very well The item is still being used Love it Thank you The item was exactly as described.  I called ATT, activated the card, popped it in my phone and it worked great! The 3g sim card always works for me. I take one and an old cellphone with charger as a backup on vacation. We have had a cellphone fall into a pool. Great piece of mind to keep the line of communication open. we are very happy that it came very fast and will always order from your company and will tell our friends the items we order was sim  cards and it was not damage at all it come very fast and had not had a problem with it thank you for being honest as trusting There is nothing else to say. It just worked! Would recommend this and buy again. The shipping was fast too. I did have to call AT&T during activation and all was smooth. The item is just as described, and priced reasonably.  needed this SIM card to start my service with this carrier.  It fits my needs perfectly. I needed to activate 3 iPhones and I couldn't get all the sims at the AT&T store so I ordered 2 from these guys and\n",

      "If this item is what you want, I couldn't recommend a quicker vendor. :) It was so much easier to buy this off amazon than to go a store and have to deal with the sales person.  Amazon you rock. I had zero issues reactivating my AT&T Go Phone with this SIM card.  I hunt in an area that my Sprint phone doesn't work but AT&T has roaming coverage so this makes it affordable to keep in touch with family and have peace of mind in case of emergency. These items are perfect for there intended use.  I was able to get them at a substantial  savings buying them here over  buying them at a Cell phone store No bells and whistles to talk about.  It does what it is supposed to at a price below what you would pay if you bought it from AT&T.  I have purchased these in the past in preparation for a trip to the US and will do so again. If you need a new SIM card for an old AT&T wireless phone, you cannot beat the value at this site.  No shipping charges either.  Saved me $23 vs buying at the store, but had to wait for a few days for it to arrive!  So if you are not married to the cell phone, you have a deal at this site! just to be clear, you need this if you have an unlocked phone and one to have a new phone number.\n",

      "I received this, enter the info in the att gophone website, it asked for the sim card number and the IMEI number from the cell, then follow some straight forward instructions and use my new site account to add money to the phone with a credit card. as for me, I saw an option to refill the phone with the prepaid gophone cards that are sold in the supermarkets but i didn't try it. They just sent this to me. Worked as expected. Don't know what else to say to get this review above 20 words. Didn't use internet on that phone, so 2G to 3G didn't make a difference to me. AT&Ts coverage was so good. I am not sure how to review this. I wasn't sure what to expect. I had no problems with this Sim Card. It was very easy to pop out of the card and install in my phone. I just had to call my provider with the updated sim information! This is my 3rd BT Headset. Out of all of them I like the Voyager the best....the reason is the Voyager has the best voice quality....very clear and loud enough for anyone. That and it fits either ear really makes it for me great. I also have a Motorola HS820, it's pretty good, but lacks some things that the Voyager seems to have down better.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I like about the Voyager compared to the 820, fits either ear...820 only fits the right ear only, sound is better, ear bud fits in the ear making it a lot easier to hear in loud environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things I wish the Voyager had that the 820 has......it's lighter, the command button is better, it's not as big over the ear, I just seem to forget that I'm wearing the 820. The Voyager I tend to know I'm wearing it, where as the 820 I forget it's on me.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing about the Voyager with the command button is that I don't hear the whole menu when it starts. I don't know if it's the transmitter link just being awaken from sleep or what....but I only hear the tail end of the prompt .....the 820 you hear the whole thing from the press of the button. Not really a big deal....but I do notice it from the 820.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall I use the Voyager the most.....but still use my 820 also.....but the voice quality blows the 820 out of the water......it's that much better. If you have any questions feel free sir_onion@yahoo\n",

      "phone used with vx8100 Very nice bluetooth headset piece, works great This is a good product. Great sound quality combined with comfortable design!!! Highly recommended!!! This has always been my favorite Bluetooth headset. It isn't the most attractive headset, but it works the best. I've tried too many to list (including the ever popular JawBone) but I prefer this headset over all others. best of the best when it comes to plantronic top choice overall I got it for my son, he still using it, so it must be good. Have many year still works great. Great product! Plantronics makes great products I have no complaints good product and great price. Exelent Product, Exelent Seller ok I've had this for years now and not one issue. Great product! works well love it good i really liked this fit well on and in my ear. didn't last a real long time. wish i had another Used this headset until I broke the earphone piece.  That was 3.5 years.  Can't ask for better quality than that. Great sound quality, comfort for wearing long hours and excellent battery life.  However, a little old school in the size and type, and requires a special proprietary charger.  Wish this charged via micro USB A very good product and I would recommend to everybody who wants to use a Bluetooth. Sound quality is good and battery time is as mentioned. But after using it for a year now I feel that the battery time has reduced. I think it happens with all products using batteries or maybe not. But I am very satisfied so far. Love this product, had been using for a while and haven't seen any problem at all, I'm strongly recommending to buy it. This product has done alot for me. i've used it with multiple phones and even my PS3 and it has never failed on me. great quality headset! easy to use and to link to. don't regret buying it. This is a very good bluetooth headset, however I recently purchased a newer Plantronics as the sound quality and smartphone compatibility has changed since I bought this one. I still use this with one of my cellphones and it has lasted over 3 years now. I've had this earpiece for years and it still works as well as it did on day one . Never had any problems; never falls out my ear. Sound is great. Like most people I have purchased multiple Bluetooth headsets and struggled with poor reception, I can't hear the caller or they can't hear me.  This Plantronics Voyager 510 headset didn't have any of these problems.  The device simply worked and I have used it for years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The headset will operate for 6 hours of talk time and 100 hours of standby time and is ideal for me to use when traveling and especially when driving.  The noise canceling microphone worked well in that people could hear me but not all the background noise like wind or rain on the windshield.  The earpiece is comfortable to wear and is light enough that you forget you have it on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The headset has the feature to operate with two Bluetooth devices simultaneously and the smart technology feature connects you to the proper device with a touch of a button.  The headset boom swivels to fit the location that is best for you and even folds into a small form for easy storage.  The head set will operate up to 33 feet from your Bluetooth device so if your phone is in your briefcase or in the back seat of the car you can still take calls.\n",
      "\n",
      "The unit also features Adaptive Frequency Hopping to find a free channel to avoid interference from other WIFI/WLAN sources.  I have tried about 10 Bluetooth devices over the years and this one was simply the one that performed the best. Over the years, my household has tried multiple Bluetooth solutions for our hands-free communications needs. We've had acceptable results from a solution integrated into GPS...but much of our regular driving doesn't include the need to load up a full-size GPS. We've had acceptable results from a visor-mounted Bluetooth speaker unit, but let's face it: sometimes we want to hold conversations that don't include everybody in the car:-)\n",
      "\n",
      "The Plantronics Voyager 510 has proven its value overs more than three years of demanding use. It fits comfortably over your ear excellent incoming and outgoing audio clarity. Best of all is its outstanding ability to hold a charge for a long time. I can generally count on more than a week between charges, even during periods of heavy use.\n",
      "\n",
      "We liked this enough to buy three...one for each driver in the house. Not the smallest or cutest bluetooth, but certainly the most reliable in my experience. I've had it for over a year and it still works perfectly, which is more than I can say for my previous bluetooth devices. I have owned this 510 for almost four years and have worn it nearly eight hours every day.  I have been very satisfied.  The cons for this ear piece are it does not block wind and background noise very well.  My ear buds are getting very loose after four years, so I am ordering another set of those.  I also ordered a new pro plus headset after watching the product demo in the wind tunnel.  Very convincing.  I will rate the new headset after I try it out.  At any rate, you can't go wrong with  the 510. The quality is good and received it within the promised time period. It could fit a little better but it's comfortable. It's probably because my ear canal is as big as the Panama Canal but oh well. I pair it to two phones everyday and it works great with both. Everyone can hear me clearly and loudly. The top part that molds is very pliable but almost too much. I wish it could hold it's form better but it doesn't it just goes back to it's original mold. Good product, I just have odd ears. I read a lot before buying this headset and was kind of nervous because some bad reviews I read but I must say it was worthy because this headset is really good, I can hear perfectly when using it, it doesn't hurts my ear or anything, I don't use it like everyday so the battery has last for almost a week so far. I have a samsung captivate and didn't had any problem pairing it and using it.\n",
      "\n",
      "5 stars! When it came, my first impression, as I took it out of the box, was that it seemed big, but that's mostly because of its configuration being mostly behind the ear.  I've been pleased with this device as it's extremely comfortable to use for extended periods of time and seems very secure on my head. Performance-wise, it's got very good sounding audio, both directions. This is my second Plantronics Bluetooth headset and I've also got a wired Plantronics earbud for my Blackberry. It seems to be a brand I can trust to give me consistently good results. Highly recommended. This is a little larger than the newer ones on the market. I tried a couple of the other ones where the hook just hangs over your ear. They started to feel uncomfortable after a while. I was looking for a headset that was comfortable and had good sound quality. After reading reviews, I picked this one up. It is definitely comfortable compared to others I've tried. It's easy to use and to pair and works great with my iPhone 4. This headset is reasonable in price and provides the best hearing and talking no matter where I am.  Size does not meam heavy. No need to write a Whole lot...this is simply the best Bluetooth you can buy... After a long search for a bluetooth ear piece I decided to choose this one for the positive reviews. I received it in a timely matter securely packaged. It included a good sized instruction booklet, a quick instruction card, 3 ear buds, wall charger, and misc warranty info.\n",
      "  I found that it paired easily to my Samsung moment. Call quality was excellent and according to the others on the line, i was clear. It is very loud, but volume is easily adjusted by the rocker on the back of the product, and the extra volume is welcome for many of the noisy environments i encountered. I also had no problems adjusting volume while in use. I did not have any difficulties ending or answering calls while wearing from the boom arm mounted button. The one thing I did not expect was the comfort level of the device. I discovered that i quite often forgot I was wearing it. The weight or fit of the device were neither a problem. The Voyager sits snugly on my ear without any pressure.\n",
      "  I also use the device for Playstation 3. It paired easily to the Playstation. On the first attempt to use the device i found that for some reason it was clipping badly, almost as if it was sampling at a very very low rate. Other players stated i was unintelligible. I gave up and decided to try again another day.\n",
      "  On the second time i tried it, it performed flawlessly, other players were crystal clear and so was I. I don't know what the initial problem was, but apperently it resolved itself.\n",
      "  The voyager supports two bluetooth devices at once, it decides which one is active at the moment and uses that one. I have found no issue with this.\n",
      "  The standy by time and talk time is impressive. I have not measured it, but it far exceeds my expectations.\n",
      "  The one thing I have noticed is that while there is a stigma for wearing a bluetooth headset, even though in many states it is necessary for answering in car calls, it is even more so with the Voyager. I still get comments at work or around with friends about the device, it is a large device and you will get the \"welcome to xxxxxx, can i take your order\" comments. The comments don't really bother me but it is a point to be brought up.\n",
      "  I have no reservations about the device and I solidly recommend it as a bluetooth headset for use with both mobile phones and Playstation 3. I got this headset in 2008, after having had several others that were all crap. I don't remember any of the brand/model #s or I would review them, too. Anyway, I got this for less than $70 when it was a new model and one of the big features for me was that it could do double-duty and worked with Skype on my computer. What I found out that made it even better, is that it works to completely remove outside sound from my laptop, and lets me hear everything on the headset... music, Google video chat, movies, everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no headset out there that is more comfortable. It sits perfectly and I can literally wear it all day and not have any pressure points bothering me. It sits perfectly in your ear, so that it feels snug and secure without pinching anywhere.  The foresight of Plantronics to send out the extra earpieces for personalized fitting is genius.  That made all the difference for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plantronics customer service is beyond compare.  Almost a year after I bought the headset, and it had a very hard year bouncing around in my purse with no case and occasionally being lost in my car or played with by my toddler, the ear nub wouldn't stay on.  I called and they sent me several to re-fit and I found one that worked, and stopped having the problem entirely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, after nearly 2 years, and several moves, I lost it. I was devastated.  I decided to upgrade to the Voyager Pro. It worked great, but was not nearly as comfortable.  After a few months of that, I bequeathed it to my son, and I have purchased another Voyager 510.  This was salvation for him, because he has been through at least 6 headsets, Jabra, Motorola, other good names, but none of them had the quality (sound and endurance) of my Plantronics.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am tempted to buy extras, in case they discontinue the model.  This is the only headset I ever want to own. I've had this for 2 years now and am pleased with quality, durability, and reliability. It is surprisingly comfortable considering the girth of the piece that goes over and behind the ear. My past headsets with earloops were horribly painful after a very short time, this one I can wear for hours, barely noticing it. It came with 3 different earpieces - one small, one large, and one teardrop shaped - so fit was not a problem. Sound quality is good enough that people frequently comment on how clear I sound and I am nearly always using it in the car. Wind cancellation really is insufficient, but this has not been a major issue for me...I just use it with the windows up or mostly up. I frequently leave this thing on overnight and still use it for a couple of days afterwards with no loss of power. Talk time is at least the 6 hours claimed and stand-by time can be measured in days.  Some people are troubled by the proprietary power cord, but it's a small matter as I have a household-type plug in my car and charge it while driving if need be, though it cannot be charged and used simultaneously.  I came here to see if I wanted to upgrade to another Plantronics model and pass this headset on to my daughter, but I think I'm going to keep it and buy her the same model.\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE:\n",
      "Still a 5 star item and I am on my second one.  After 2.5 years the first one broke at the top of the earloop.  I taped it with sports tape and kept using it without any problems, but I figured it was only a matter of time before it didn't work anymore so I replaced it. Others have said that the new 510s are junk, but I've been using mine for about 5 months now and it's exactly as great as the original.  The broken one is still working, too. Tried many, but this one is only one I can use while driving noisy truck. I am replacing my old Plantronics Voyager 510 with a new Voyager 510.  I plain wore out the last device.  I work in an outdoor service environment, requiring I wear hearing protection.  This requires me to frequently remove it from service and put it in a pocket or the console of my vehicle.  It took quite a beating over the 2+ years I had it.  I bought my wife one for Christmas when a hands-free device in cars became law in this state.  It does a good job in volume adjustment and has very good clarity.  The earpiece inserts gently into the ear, making it easier to hear the person on the other end than other units that \"hang\" over the ear.  It also keeps the unit comfortably in place.  I appreciate the noise-canceling feature as well, which is a big plus in noisy environments.  I also like the rechargeable litheon-ion battery technology: I can use this unit for days between charges.  Unless they can improve on this headset, I hope it remains in production for a long time to come. My family has burned through numerous bluetooth headsets from cheap to high dollar (jawbone).\n",
      "We purchased three of these for Christmas and they are fantastic. Large enough so that you won't lose it easily. The ear loop is sturdy yet flexible and hugs your ear. No chance of it flying off you head.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clarity and signal are good. Only a little interference on rare ocasions. We tested it on how far the phone could be from the headset and still be useable. I stayed in the house with the phone, my husband walked outside into the back yard (quite a distance) and we could still hear each other no problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with other headsets, there is a short delay on occasion. No problem with external noise. We tested in a convertible and it was fine.  Charge last is okay. Other headsets I have used have a better charge, but quality is for worse. Highly recommend especially for the price. I actually tossed my high dollar jaw bone for this one. I have had several Bluetooth headsets over the years and this one so far has been the best:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Four stars for length of comfort time\n",
      "2. Five stars for reliability (super clear both ways)\n",
      "3. Five stars for talk time and stand bye time\n",
      "4. Five stars for re-charge time\n",
      "5. Five stars for design (especially for those of us who wear glasses)\n",
      "6. Four stars for ear inserts ( needed one size smaller than what it came with for my ears as the smallest insert will not fit as snugly as it needs to for a perfect fit.....the headset sometimes falls off my ear when I lean over to tie my shoes or something and I would definitely not go jogging with it. The positive reviews are accurate - this is a great product - very easy to hear and people on the other end can hear me well. The ear piece fits securely and comfortably. What more could you ask? Highly recommended. The reviews available on this product from the amazon website really helped me make a great decision. This model may not be the \"latest\" technology but it's enough for me. I only use it in the car because of all the issues that have been raised about driving safety. I feel better with both hands on the wheel, both eyes on the road. I'm not a device geek but this really works for me and the few requirements i have. Simple to use, I set it up in 10 min max. Fits fine, but I do activate the connection before i go down the road because the buttons are small and can be difficult to activate if you already have it behind your ear. Great wind noise reducing headset.  Works well in any condition. Light weight even though it appears to be bigger than some units.  Most comfortable fitting headset I've ever used. If I had one negative thing to say it would be that sometimes people tell me that I need to speak up while using the device but that is very rare and could possibly have to do with me and not the device itself. This has to be one of the best headsets out there, I have used many and this unit has to be one to beat. No issues whatsoever, great quality and easy to use.. This product technology might be a little dated, but it works the best so far. I have had at least 4 bluetooth headsets in the last 6 years and this one performed the best. Clear sound (that gets loud) and comfortable in the ear. Nobody asks me to keep repeating myself while using this headset, I like it. I waited to review this product to see if time would show it is no good, and it did not show me that.  This is the best blue tooth device i have ever seen or used and have already convinced 3 other people to switch.  The battery lasts for I would guess about 8 hrs of talk time and 2-3 weeks without a charge with me only using it a little each day.  The sound is better than using my phone and people can hear me without any static. The only improvement that I can think of is to put a battery meeter to let you know how much power is left instead of it just dying on you.  I just try to charge it every 1-2 weeks now before it dies and it is great. The Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset is perfect in reception and transmission.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset functions flawlessly. However, I found that the design of the headset makes it an inconvenience to put on. Apart from the flawed ergonomics, this headset is just about perfect - 4.5 Stars! I have been using it for about a week and it is very easy to use. I am using it with an Axecom VOIP phone system and it's incredibly easy. Just plug it into the the headset jack on the bottom and you go. Simply awesome, the best one I ever had, sticking to this one after 1 motorola, 1 nokia and 1 samsung. GOOD SOUND QUALITY, HIGH VOLUME EVEN WITH OPEN WINDOWS AT A VERY REASONABLE PRICE. THIS EARPIECE IS VERY LIGHT ON THE EAR, YOU WILL FORGET IS THERE. THREE EASY FIT PIECES FOR THE COMODITY OF THE EAR, CHOOSE YOURS.\n",
      "HIGHLY RECOMMENDED... This is an amazing device. I connect it to both my cell phone and to my office VoIP laptop solution through the bluetooth.  It's crystal clear and everyone asked if I bought a new phone as it was so much clearer for them to hear.  I'm very pleased with the quality and sound from this. And the great thing is at full volume it's LOUD... no more having to worry about hearing anyone!!! We have tried everything from the moto-850 to the other plantronics and after seeing this in a gold box deal thought what the heck.  To my amazement it has been really a fantastic headset. Easy to pair, easy to adjust volume, great battery life, very clear even with wind noise and city sounds around, and last but not least it has an indicator light that does not look like an emergency strobe (I hated my mot-850 for that at night it would reflect off the glass and the dash in the car or the side window and drive you insane...)\n",
      "\n",
      "All and all a 5 star unit My husband bought this for me after I bought my current phone. I thought it was going to be a big waste of money - \"I don't need a wireless headset - a traditional wired one will work just fine\" I told him. But he had already bought me this one. It works better than the wired one I used to have. I'm surprised it still works at all. I can't tell you how many times I dropped it. I lost it in my car for a week in Arizona's 110++ August temperatures. I am not exactly gentle with this thing, and it is still going strong - like the little engine that could. I got it for mother's day 2008. I was upset with my husband for not getting the car charger for it. I kept on forgetting to order one. Now I'm just not going to bother. I just plug it in once a week in the house. The one time the battery went dead on me was when I didn't charge it for three weeks out of curiosity - I wanted to see how long the battery would last. I don't talk on it a lot compared to most people - maybe two or three hours a week - but I do have it on whenever I am driving and at the store etc... about 7 or 8 hours a week. I still love the looks I get when people think I am talking to myself - I have long dark hair so you can't see the bluetooth on my ear. I jokingly call it my borg implant. I bought the 510 to replace the Jawbone V2, which is good when it wants to be. The 510 has the same functions the Jawbone does at a fraction of the price, $38 v. $95.\n",
      "If you want a bluetooth that has a ton of bells and whistles, then get this headset. First off; this thing is huge. And it's not something that you're going to easily fit in your pocket, it doesn't fold up well.\n",
      "\n",
      "That aside, it's great at everything else.\n",
      "-Fit: unlike most other headsets (especially the *terrible* jawbone series!), this fits wonderfully. It had three earpieces you can try, but even without that the large size and over-the-ear design makes it hold on your ear snugly but comfortably. I could take a punch to the face and not lose the headset; if I were merely to glance down the jawbone type would fall off...\n",
      "-Battery: honestly, I haven't pushed it, but I bet it outlasts everything around. My God, look at the SIZE of that thing! It's gotta have a great battery, right?\n",
      "-Sound: Hard to say, since I must go off of what the other end says. Seems to be good. No complaints while using in the car or even outside (I think the hard foam endpiece helps with wind noise).\n",
      "-Price: Not one of the uber-cheap new bluetooths or anything, but not $75-100 dollar fashionista prices either (*cough*, jawbone, *cough*).\n",

      "The power button is fidly (is it a rocker switch? Or a button?), and I'm still getting used to the volume rocker. I'm just happy it *has* a volume rocker, and not some ridiculous one-way-volume adjustment button. The call button is very easy to reach and press.\n",
      "\n",
      "No problems syncing it with my phone either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, supposedly there is an adapter you can use to use this on your landline, if you are the type who still has one of those things. The last bluetooth device I owned had poor reception. The sound quality on this device is clear enough to hear in my car with the windows down. I would recommend to anyone.  Great ear piece! I've actually bought a couple of these over the past 2 years.  Mine finally broke after 2 years and I dug out my wife's unused 510 as a replacement.  Tried a Jawbone 2 and it just didn't work properly with my Microsoft Voice Command software - must be something to do with the delays in noise reduction.  Also couldn't get the thing to stay in my ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some reason, this one had tons of problems with background noise and essentially was unusable in the car.  So just now I called Plantronics and they offered to ship me a new one, no problem.  So even though the product is great the service is even better.  I was so shocked by the spectacular service even though the headset in question was well over a year old and sitting in a drawer.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you've had problems with fit on other headsets, try this one.  It's magic. I always check Consumer Reports for ratings before purchasing goods. They rated this bluetooth as a \"Best Buy\" and it was rated excellent for sound quality. I figured that to be the most important feature in a bluetooth headset, so I ordered one some months ago from a seller on Ebay (for the same price as the 2 I bought on Amazon). I LOVE mine...so, for Christmas I ordered one for my husband and one for his daughter--ad they both LOVE them, too. If I have any 'criticism' whatsoever, it is that the headset is easily 'bumped off' the ear by a coat collar, etc., but its not like you wouldn't notice it ;-). The sound quality is excellent--so much better than trying to hold a rigid cell phone up to your ear to try to hear someone talking. My husband has diminished hearing and this has been wonderful for him, as he can adjust the volume accordingly. In short, we think these are great! Not only that, the price on Amazon is less than 50% of the manufacturer's website price. It is an excellent buy in my opinion. Great Bluetooth headset. This is my second one - the first was stolen so I purchased one just like it. I have had mine for two years. It still works for days and days between chargers. It still filters noise outside. And, it still works perfectly! It hangs perfectly off of my ear. You will need to be ok with wearing a device over your ear, and with the larger battery behind the ear. The battery lasts for weeks, the sound quality is great, and the connection to device is pretty fast. For the age of the technology, this thing is outstanding. Bought this with the unit that converts your desk phone to a bluetooth compatible headset - best buy for the money!  I talk on the phone most of the day when in the office, and use both the desk line and my cell phone.  The system allows me to use the same headset for both.  Good battery life. I have owned other BT headsets, but this one is my favorite. It stays on your ear, and the sound is great. The fit took some adjusting, and I have decided to remove all but the cone-shaped earpiece. The foam pads made the earpiece too large, and a bit painful. Without it, the headset is great. It is a bit heavy at first, but after a few minutes, you will forget that you have it on. This little ugly-ish set is still ruling the market with great sound quality for both its owners and people they talk to.  I have owned or tested several supposedly great Bluetooth sets with several different phones and devices including iPhone 3G, Motorola Razr and L6, Blackberry 7100i, two different laptops (Skype) and Playstation 3, and no other headset performed as well as Plantronics Voyager 510.\n",
      "\n",
      "In parallel with this device I had three different Jabras including BT250, BT500 and JX10 and neither one comes close to the sound quality and wind tolerance of Voyager 510.  I also learned of a number of users including my boss who switched from Jawbone 1 AND 2 to this or Discovery 925 set due to fit, comfort and sound issues, so I never even bothered to buy a Jawbone.  With Plantronics Voyager 510, people I talk to can't even tell I'm using a Bluetooth headset; not even when I'm driving, which I find amazing.  Since it's been over four years in my never ending quest for the perfect Bluetooth headset that I constantly keep researching and reverting to this little \"mule\", I just have to give it five stars in spite of its mainly cosmetic flaws.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's why I got to appreciate this somewhat clumsy set so much:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Good output volume and quality. When I'm using Plantronics Voyager 510, people I'm talking to can't tell I'm on a cell phone with a Bluetooth headset - not even when I'm driving (windows closed). The case was the opposite when I was using Jabras, when I used to hear complaints about noise, static and low volume of my voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Good and controllable earphone volume. It can reasonably well deal with traffic noise when I'm walking outside my downtown Chicago office. I can set the volume really loud, so the only case when I cannot hear my partner is when I'm walking too close to a moving train. My usual volume setting is around 1/3.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. This set's microphone tolerates wind better than the Jabras mentioned above which used to produce a great deal of wind noise whenever I was encountering a breeze. In addition, if I know I'll be outside in a windy environment I can put the included microphone sponge on.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Good battery life. I don't have to charge it often.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Although it seems very light and gentle in my hands, it handles everyday folding and switching between my shirt pocket and both my ears very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. No problems with long usage, unlike Jabra BT250, which used to irritate the skin on the back of my ear if I used it too long or too often.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never heard about Plantronics before buying this headset and I grew to appreciate it a lot more after years of usage. Only recently I discovered that Plantronics has a long history with headsets and that even the Apollo missions used their headsets on the Moon. Makes sense. \"One small set for man, one giant leap away from other BT headsets. Houston, we have no problem\". I have used the the Voyager 510 for two years. i have used it in every conceivable configuration. It has worked admirably with my two windows mobile devices (xv6700 and 6800). It even worked fairly well doing skype calls on the 6700 but not the 6800. I connect it everyday to my office VOIP phones(grandstream) at work and at home using the BF8 base units. The range is quite good with the base units (about 30ft.)I frequently use my 510's connected to both the base units and my cell phone at the same time. I have used it with my laptop for Skype and MSn calling with great success. The unit is quite rugged and easily stored in the pocket once you learn to turn the boom to vertical. There is no other ear-set this versatile and rugged. It is a thoroughly professional device for people serious about making and receiving clear phone calls. The ear-set is much more secure in the ear than others and allows me to wear it whilst crawling around, upside down and so forth. I use the ear-gels that are provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "The negative: I have had two units that just quit charging. I suspect the copper charger contacts corroded. In both cases Plantronics replaced them incredibly fast and with very little hassle. If you perspire you have to clean these contacts quickly. They should change them to gold contacts.\n",
      "The base units contacts also corrode quickly here in Hawaii.\n",
      "There is an audio quality problem when used with digital VOIP phones. I believe it is a conflict between the codec( or some other technical conflict) of the ear-set and the phone. I suspect all ear-sets may have this compatibility problem. This headset could be a bit more comfortable (or could it? I don't even like wearing the earbuds for my ipod), but isn't too bad.  I like wearing it for long car trips when I don't want to search for and fumble with my phone if I get an important call.  It's very easy to use--just hit the button on the headset to answer a call--and it holds a charge for a ridiculously long time (especially if you don't talk nonstop).  Overall, I'm satisfied and am buying a second one for a gift. I ordered this product so I could talk handsfree in the car with the air conditioner running.  It worked as well as I had hoped. They are comfortable, they pick up voice easily and well, the sound is great, and the design is so comfortable that you have to feel with your fingers to find out if they are on. After using a low-end JABRA bluetooth for the past year, this Plantronics voyager is so welcome!  It paired easily with my phone and with the different ear cushions, you can have one custom for your ear canal.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I found it to fit easily onto my ear and hold well, my boyfriend who has his ears more flat against his head had a hard time hooking it on his ear and having it stay there without much adjustment needed.  Also, he said that it was too bulky for his liking, but I like it just fine!\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound quality is great, I can hear others well and I'm told that I come through very clearly.  I have had it for almost 2 months and only had to charge it once besides that first time and I use it everyday for 1-2 hours each time - that's good battery life! An incredibly reliable headset for your cell phone. I purchased mine over a year ago and it has served me well. The Plantronics 510 is a good-looking headset with superb audio quality. The recharger is a bit cheap but the headset is a well-rounded headset that is comfortable and features easy volume control and reliability. I gave one of these away 2 years ago, when it failed to stay paired with my BB Pearl.  Decided to give it another try with my MotoQGlobal (ATT), and am thoroughly satisfied.  Reception is great, and there is an audible signal for every function, including receipt of e-mail or text messages.  Great purchase at just over $40!!\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE 8/5/2009: Just stopped working, with no warning.  Out of warranty, unfortunately. Yes, I have three headsets.  I have two for the car, and one for use in the house.  I chose to put the best one, this one, in the car along with a second cheap one, as a backup.  I'm terrible at remembering to charge these guys up!  And I'm too cheap to purchase a car charger...\n",
      "\n",
      "This is really a great headset.  I've never had a problem with people not being able to hear me and it's very comfortable to wear.  The battery lasts a long time, which is one reason I just forget to charge it.  Once the battery dies, I use my backup headset until I charge up my favorite!\n",
      "\n",
      "The other headsets are cheapy models I've purchase on amazon when they were a Goldbox deal, and those are also good.  They were around  $10 and work fine.  They just are not as comfortable to wear and the sound quality is not as sharp, both for me and for who I am speaking with.  If I wear the cheapy ones for more than 15 minutes, my ear will start to ache a little.  I can wear this one all day if I wanted to and it wouldn't bother me at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would purchase this one again FOR SURE.  I've had mine for about 18 months and I'm sure at some point I will trash it and need another.  I'm really happy with this headset. The Plantronics Voyager 510 has been an absolute work horse for me for the past nearly 2 years. When I say workhorse I mean it. I put over 5 hours of talk time on this device 5 days a week for well over a year. I used it in a weekly 4 hour commute, during the day in the office, at night to talk to my family from the hotel and a number of other usages. I know this device and using it is as familiar as turning on my blinker in the car.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Good:\n",
      "1. Great noise filtering. The microphone does a great job of filtering out ambient noise including wind.\n",
      "2. The battery is excellent and lasts for days on standby and for at least 6 hours talking.\n",
      "3. Multipoint Technology. This technology rocks. I have both my work (Blackberry) and personal cell phone synched with this device at the same time and can call or answer either without pairing hassles.\n",
      "4. Pairs with a device that it has been setup with by simply pressing the primary button.\n",
      "5. Volume buttons on earpiece.\n",
      "6. Comes with multiple earpieces for comfort.\n",
      "7. Stable in the ear. It doesn't feel as if it will fall out.\n",
      "8. Durable. I used this hard for a few years and it has only now started to fall apart. Still works though.\n",
      "9. Shares common power supply with many other Plantronics devices for ease of power sharing.\n",
      "10. Larger then competitors but very light.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Not so Good:\n",
      "1. It is bigger then most other devices.\n",
      "2. The earpieces are prone to fall out and don't stay secured after about 6 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you can see I really don't have much bad to say about this device. I am only now replacing it after 2 years of use and that is because the earpiece fell out and I can't find the pack that came with it. It still works! I replaced this unit with the Plantronics Discovery 925 and I might like that even better. For the money though you cannot beat the Voyager 510 in my opinion. 5 stars!

I have owned several Bluetooth cell phone headsets, and the PLT 510 is the best so far. It fits my ear perfectly, I can wear it for hours without noticing it, and it gives great sound. I had no problem syncing it to my iPhone, and although I haven't tried any other devices, I anticipate no problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "I only have two complaints:\n",
      "1. The on-off switch is very small and hard to use. I find that I have to push it with my thumbnail to make it work. If you have smaller fingers, you may have less of a problem.\n",
      "2. Plantronics uses a proprietary connector for charging, while other manufacturers are switching to mini or micro USB. A proprietary charging interface means one more wire to carry with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, a great purchase. I've gotten three of these headsets so far, for friend and family. You can't go wrong. couldn't be happier with this. and those who are embarrassed by its \"large\" size may want to consider being less insecure. This is a really great headset for those of us that love talking hands free. This is the best Bluetooth I have had.  It is clear and very comfortable.  All the others I have tried hurt my ear after a while but this one never does.  It's like you aren't even wearing it.  It is clear when people are talking to you as well as clear to them when you are talking.  You can't go wrong this this headset at all. This is, by far, the BEST bluetooth headset I have ever owned. I've tried all the Motorola ones, and they pale in comparison to the Plantronics. You can see by all the positive reviews that this thing is amazing.  I can walk all over my house while my phone is in one spot, and talk without any interference.  The only problem is that I always forget where I put my phone!  The range on this headset is truly amazing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound quality is amazing as well.  No one can ever tell I'm on a headset. And once you start using this, you'll soon wonder how you ever lived without it. I can't tolerate holding a phone to my ear anymore because this headset makes life SO much easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I've had mine for over two years without any problems. I accidentally forgot I left it in my sweatshirt pocket and WASHED IT, and it still works!  I couldn't believe it.  Sure, the battery life suffers after years of use, but they're so cheap that it's no problem at all to get a new one.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only complaint is that the blue light on it is extraordinarily BRIGHT. I can't charge this thing at night without covering it up because it's like a blue lighthouse in my room.  And when it's on, the flashing blue light is VERY annoying in dark rooms (e.g. watching a movie).  That's really my only complaint.\n",
      "\n",
      "You really cannot go wrong on a bluetooth headset for such little money.  Don't even think twice! I've recommended this heaset to about 10 different people, who all LOVE it. Wonderful bluetooth headset.  Great sound and minimal background noise for those on the other end of the phone.  Connected easily to my Sanyo Katana II cellular phone as well as my bluetooth USB device for both use with both my Skype and Vonage talk accounts.  Only complaint, the volume control could be easier to adjust.  I end up using the the volume control on the phone which is a bit easier and I can see where the level setting is at. I have probably went through a 1/2 dozen different bluetooths...mostly Motorola.  This one blows them all away.  The voice clarity is great even outdoors.  It is the only one I have found that is loud enough to be used in something other than a very quite environment.  I can actually hear the other person talking on the phone even if I am working outside.  Very impressed. Update 11/11/2008\n",
      "My wife's died about two weeks ago. I emailed the company explaining I bought it from Amazon and mentioned it is within the warranty period. I did not hear anything for about a week, and then, a replacement appeared at my house, sent via express mail. It is a refurb, but that is their condition, and it looks and works perfectly. Awesome customer service. Just one more reason to get this product!\n",
      "\n",
      "I have used this for a month, and I love it. I have been searching for a decent bluetooth headset, and after using it for about a month, I can tell you it is great. The sound is very good and clear. I have no complaints from anyone I speak with, and usually they don't even know I am using a headset. There are only two negatives, and they really are not that bad. First, turning it on and off is not easy. That is not really a bad thing, but it is a little awkward. My second complaint would take off half a star, and that is, my usb car charger cannot work with it, and I had to buy a seperate charger. It is much easier to answer and hang up, when compared to others I have used. It is VERY comfortable, and I sometimes forget that I am wearing it., as witnessed by my wife who often reminds me tha tI am still wearing it. I bought this because my wife's set died and she needed a new one. Ehem, it seems that I somehow ended up with this one and she got my old piece of &$#%(@ (insert your guess of brand here) because she was used to it. Well, she now has her own and loves it as well, though she also complains about the on/off button. I should also note that my Verizon Razor, which often would not recognize the Verizon blue tooth headset I had, has no problem QUICKLY hooking up with this headset. I really love it and would recommend it to anyone. Lastly, the battery life is very good. I have tested many bluetooth headsets. This one sets the bar pretty high.  The battery life is wonderful usually outlasting a phone charge by a factor of two. It is generally compatible with just about all the regular phones.  If you have a Palm OS phone, pick a different headset as this MAY work, but has some issues that I find are difficult to live with.\n",
      "\n",
      "The good: This is a very durable headset (mine went through the washer and dryer and still works after it dried out for a few days).  The multiple options for ear pieces, flexibility of the design (switching ears without carrying extra accessories), compatibility with lots of phones, antenna design solving cross body communications for some phones, charging options with USB and power (you can wear it while charging comfortably), and battery life all are great. It connects to 2 devices at a time though you can obviously only answer one of them at a time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bad: (all minor) The wind smart does not work that great.  I have yet to find a bluetooth headset that can handle direct wind noise and this is no exception. It does better than most but remote parties still complain. Every headset I have tested fails here. This is difficult to distinguish between mute on the headset and power off. I tuned it off a few times on accident when trying to mute.  Oops. The mute also does not alert you frequently enough that it is on, but you can still mute from the phone separately without issues.  Pairing is simple, but not just a one button option.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would suggest this headset to users looking for a good headset for most devices. Consider other options with Palm OS phones. Let's just get down to it.  If you are reading this review because you are shopping for a new Bluetooth headset, just go ahead and finishing reading the next couple sentences and then you can do what I did... buy the Plantronics Voyager 510 at Amazon (for under $45.00 as of this review).  I own 10 different headsets and have used them all to make hundreds of calls in all types of environments, and since we can only really rate products on a curve, there is currently no better choice at this time (things will no doubt change one day).  It is the most stable, the most ergonomic, the most static free (there is no such thing as a completely static free wireless product), the most efficient with it's battery usage, most comfortable (a somewhat subjective attribute), the most bang for the buck, the most satisfying to use, and the most 5 star rated Bluetooth Headset money can buy.  I can only really complain about one thing... a very sensitive microphone that will pick up wind noise in moderately windy conditions (in spite of the noise cancelling technology), but this is certainly true with every headset that I have used and probably true with ALL headsets when you come down to it. It works flawlessly with my HTC TyTN, HTC Advantage and the HTC Excalibur S621.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will buy it next time too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Happy customer. Great reception, connects anywhere in the house.  The multipoint technology allows me to connect to my phone AND computer (for Skype) simultaneously.\n",
      "\n",
      "The headpiece itself is very comfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update:  Two years later and the headset is still going strong.  The earpiece popped out and lost the little rubber grommet, but a dab of superglue put everything back together again without problems.  I'm still on my original foam earpiece and still have no complaints. No complaints from this headset.  It's comfortable in the ear, has a mute function and works flawlessly with my PS3 and KRAZR! I have tried 3 different headsets with the last being the Plantronics 665 which is a newer version than the voyager 510.  I use the 510 with a Blackberry 8820 and so far it has worked flawlessly and I've been using it for about 1 week.  The sound is clear and loud and the background noise that other people hear is very minimal, even when driving with the windows down.  On my other headsets, when talking to other people, they all said that it sounded like I was talking through a tunnel, but on this headset, the Voyager 510, I've had everyone say that they couldn't tell I was talking via Bluetooth.  This headset may be a little bigger than some of the newer models that are out now, but once you put it on, it is very comfortable and you can't tell the size.\n",
      "Factoring in the price and the performance of this headset, I highly recommend you buy this Bluetooth headset if you're in the market. The Voyager 510 isn't exactly the sexiest dongle to hang from your ear... but who cares if it works great? =p\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I got this, it works great with just my cell phone, but I figured that I'd actually experiment with the MultiPoint technology. And I can say that it's kind of neat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pairing it with my cell phone and my laptop wasn't too much of a hassle. I, as well as any future buyers, may be glad to know that this device supports the A2DP protocol (audio transfer), which means that you can listen to music on your laptop with your headset (although it is less than desirable quality), and if you get a call on your cell phone, you can hit the call button once to disconnect yourself from your laptop to connect to your cell phone, then hit the call button again to answer your phone. All without touching either device. =p One minor gripe, however, is that it's not very convenient to switch back to being paired with my laptop, since I have to pair the headset with my laptop again. Maybe there's a way for my laptop to \"call\" the headset so that I can switch connections the same way I did it for a phone call, but I'm not sure as to how to do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound quality of this headset is very good. People can hear me clearly and I can hear them quite well, actually. Most headsets suffer the bane of crappy volume levels; the Voyager 510 seems to amplify the volume so that normally-soft phone calls are clear and audible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The buttons are less than desirable, though. I'm not sure if it's just me, but the volume is a little difficult to adjust while the headset is on my ear, and the power button is just impossible to get at while on my ear. You need to power it on and off after taking it off. The call button on my first headset became defective after a few months (which would explain my hours of frustration on not being able to pair the darn thing to my computer), but I'm sure it was a lemon. Update on this will follow if the call button goes on my current 510.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of ears, I can wear this thing rather comfortably for an hour or two at a time without too much discomfort. (I never had this on for more than a couple of hours at a time.)\n",
      "\n",
      "This is definitely a great headset to grab if you're looking for one that just works. If you're looking for style... you might want to look elsewhere. I've tried the Motorola ones and either I couldn't hear or the person on the other end couldn't hear (usually both).  I bought this based on a recommendation of a Realtor that swore by it, and to be honest, I have only had occasional trouble with it.  It's comfortable to wear, it's easy to hear, the other person hears me.  I wear it most of the day, on project sites, while driving, even at home.  It works as expected and I'm very pleased with the results.  If you need a bluetooth, this is the one. I love this bluetooth that I had to get one for my friend because it worked so well I have owned over a dozen different models of bluetooh headsets.  This is the best sounding and most comfortable of all of them so far. The range is good, battery life is good I only wish they came with more ear inserts as spares. I've had 3 headsets already, and each one had something about it that I didn't like. I hesitated to buy this one, despite the great reviews, because I wanted one that didn't give me the 'telemarketer' look. Top things I was looking for were: sound quality, comfort, and battery life. This unit delivers on all 3 counts. It sounds fantastic, it's really comfortable (especially with the Jabra EarGels on the ear piece), and the battery lasts a long time. Looking back, this is the one that I should have bought in the first place. Recommended. I don't have a Bluetooth phone, but bought the 510 to work with my MacBook (and Mac Mini). Well it works great. No drivers, it just works. I'm using it with Skype, Photo Booth, and as a headset for Itunes and other apps that would normally use the speakers but I need private listening. I bought this on a reccomendation of a friend.  My brother bought a Motorolla earpiece for about $30 more than I paid for mine.  he hates his and I love mine.  Most people never realize I am talking to them through a headset.  You get 3 ear speakers of different sizes so you attach the one that is most comfortable for your ear.\n",

      "Best addition to my cell phone I have ever bought. For several years I used a Logitech Bluetooth for my cell phone, and while it worked great, it was always uncomfortable. When it snapped in two, I decided on the Voyager 510! Wow, not only does it work great, but it is VERY, VERY COMFORTABLE! In fact, I can honestly say I actually forget that I am wearing it, something I cannot say about my previous device. So for all of you thinking of a headset, you cannot go wrong with this one! Five stars! The Voyager 510 is very comfortable to wear and was easy to setup. The speaker volume is good with little or no static. Plus the it doesn't look like a block of plastic hanging off your ear. I highly recommend this headset. Works great.  I had a Motorola H350 and would get complaints that I was difficult to hear. I also had trouble hearing people even at full volume.  With this unit I have to turn the volume down and no complaints about being heard.  It is comfortable to wear and I also use it with Skype on my computer.  My only complaint would be the size of the unit.  It is not as compact as other units. The reason to get this headset is comfort. It's bulkier than most headset, but it is sooo comfortable. Sometimes i forget i'm wearing it, which is really geeky. I think the call quality is pretty good. and the multipoint connection is useful. I have a personal and a work cell phone and it connects to both. but sometimes it looses connection to one and it's hard to realize that when i'm driving. Pros: lightweight, great sound quality and battery life. Also multipoint bluetooth works fine and is great for using it with the cell phone or the PC as an audio gateway (e.g.: Skype for voice calls)\n",
      "Cons: May require some initial practice to put it on the first times An excellent product. The ear piece is comfortable and doesn't hurt. My prior unit hurt my ear after an hour. The sound is clear. I would recommend it to everyone. No complaints here. Excellent sound quality - the volume can be turned up nice and loud. Fewest \"bluetooth clicking noises\" of any bluetooth device I've used. Hardly hear them at all unless you walk to far away from the source.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have this Voyager 510 paired with both my Treo 650 and Skype on my laptop (using the Anycom USB 250 I reviewed previously) The headset picks up the call from whoever rings first every time. I love it!! Skype call comes in, and the headset rings - call comes in on the Treo 650 and the headset rings. What's not to like???\n",
      "\n",
      "I love the fit too - I think it's the best I've tried on. I also have the Scala 700x which is about as light you could imagine in a headset. But, it's almost a little too light (and fragile). Honestly, I like them both but need to have a backup. Now that I think of it, I believe my wife just inherited a Scala 700x.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 510 feels like it's built to take some abuse which I think is a plus and yet it's lighter than I expected - to be honest. It's been around for a little while so I was afraid it might be a little heavy. I'm pleasantly surprised that it's very light. I mean the fit is so perfect, you could go running while wearing it or certainly work out in the gym without any worries.\n",
      "\n",
      "I haven't put the \"wind cancellation\" to the test yet but I will and then I'll update this review. But, honestly, when I saw all the positive reviews here on Amazon (1200 or so?) and many of them Treo 650 users, I figured it was a fairly safe bet and I'm very satisfied with the purchase so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Scala works great with the Treo 650 too. It's hard to tell which one sounds louder - I'll experiment a little more and then write in once I have a winner. Ever since i bought this headset I have become a fan of it. Its so comfortable I can wear it whole day without even feeling anythin is on, voice is crystal clear and its very easy to use. It pairs perfectly with my nokia 6610 as well as with my Dell Laptop so i use it for both VOIP calls and mobile phone calls. Also the service was great. I received the package right on the estimated date and never had to followup with anyone. A Superb Product !!! This headset has been great.  The worst thing about it is that sometimes it's too loud. I've owned and used several different models over a couple of years, and the 510 is hands down the best I've used so far.  Battery life is excellent, fit is excellent, sound quality and mic quality is excellent.  Got mine when the price temporarily dipped to under $40, cannot beat it at this price.  Highly recommended. The only real problem with this headset is how large it is.  I have small ears and it barely hooks around good enough. It can take me a minute to get the top part of the loop over my ear just right to get it to stay.  For normal size ears this should not a problem.  Other than that this thing actually works pretty well!  Even the other Plantronics and different headsets that I've tried (610, Jabar, nokia 810) will disconnect or crackle if you have the phone in a lower pocket on the opposite side but this one almost never does.  Just keep the phone on the same side as the headset and it should be good.  Despite what one person said, of course it comes with an AC charger.  That person should return theirs for another, properly packaged one with the charger. i love it. it has made my cell phone experiene that much more convienient. i have had no problems, easy to follow instructions. I have had two motorola bluetooth headsets and they both either did not have a clear signal or when you are speaking with someone there was an echo. This one I got from Plantronics is by far the best I have ever had and from what I've read the best on the market right now. I would advise bluetooth shoppers to stay away from Motorola bluetooth headsets. I work for Verizon Wireless in their tech support department and I have yet to use a better Bluetooth headset. I've owned 4 over the last year; a Jabra, a Motorola, this one and another Plantronics. And I've used several different ones over time in the testing process, and this is easily the best I've used. The earlier Plantronics was also very good as well. The Jabra didn't have very good noise-reduction and the Motorola was a terrible purchase altogether. But this headset I can say with ease is superb. Great sound, it picks up very little in the way of ambient noise, and the charge lasts forever, seemingly!\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE: When I originally purchased this device over 2 years ago, I di have to replace it back in July. Why? Because I had it in a messenger bag that got stepped on. I used it just about every day, and the only reason I had to get a new headset is because it was physically damaged. Guess which headset I got to replace it? THE SAME ONE! If the previous one worked for over 2 years and only stopped working because it got stepped on, then this is the one I'm sticking with for as long as they make them. I finally purchased a bluetooth phone (Samsung A900) and was pleased to find that the headset was easy to connect and works better than expected. Now I don't have to be jealous of other nerds who walk around with things sticking out of their ears. Excellent headset, everyone says the quality of the audio is great.  I liked it so much that when I lost the first one at the airport, I bought a second one to replace it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the price, it is an exceptional buy. Great sound, great transmission. Lightweight, comfortable.  Maybe not the easiest to get on as it curls around the ear...or I'm just challenged.  However, once mounted, it's pretty secure!\n",
      "\n",
      "Linking to my LG 8300 cell phone was a breeze. This works well and is comfortable, vs the couple of MOT headsets I bought, which were horible. The volume level is good for me, and I have hearing loss, so that's impressive as well. The contols are easy to use. I'm using this with an older MOT V330. Highly recommended for both the performance and price. Oh, contrary to another reviewers suggestion, it will not fit into a mint tin due to it's width. I haven't found a good hard-case solution for it yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update on 8/16/08:\n",
      "I thought I lost my 510, so after reviewing all the newer units, I bought another one! The newer models appear to be riddled with minor bugs & issues, so why not stick with a winner? I'm now using this with my T-Mobile Dash and it works great for the voice command features. My office was trying to decide on which model to go with, so we ordered up a half a dozen latest models of headsets. I added my own to the evaluation pool. After two weeks of testing, almost everyone liked the 510 better than all the rest, so we ordered up 20 of them! If this model was discontinued and I needed a new headset, I'd go with the latest \"jawbone\"; which worked fine, had better wind resistance, but didn't have quite the all-day comfort or inherent design durability of the 510. Hope this helps! On the strength of the very high rating and huge reviewer feedback here on Amazon, I bought this Bluetooth device -- my first bluetooth headset ever.  I finally have a phone that has Bluetooth capability, and I was keenly interested in a wireless headset that wouldn't have the cord tangle issues of corded headsets.\n",
      "\n",
      "This device does exactly what I wanted it to do.  It was a piece of cake to setup on my Verizon Samsung u540 phone.  You wouldn't even need to crack open the user manual except to discover the 4-digit code you have to plug-in to your phone (it's 0000, btw).  After that, it's a snap to turn on and link to my phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "My other important concern was voice clarity, both on sending and receiving.  Thus far, after several hours of use, I can tell you that the voice reception I hear is crystal clear.  No crackling, no hollowing or echoing.  On the other end, I've not had anyone complain about being unable to hear my voice or that my voice is coming across muddled -- interestingly, I've had such complaints while using my old, corded headset!\n",
      "\n",
      "The power button *is* small and it *is* a tad more difficult to depress than you might want, but then, you won't accidentally turn on or turn off this device because of the way it's designed.  I agree with others -- turn on the device before putting it on your ear, and do the same when you're turning it off.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for noise canceling, my wife and I tested out this device in very noisy home with four small kids, and I was very pleasantly surprised at how well this headset communicated my voice but not the ambient noise in the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the volume control on the headset was pretty easy to do.  Note that you can control voice volume either through the phone handset volume control or the control on this Plantronics headset.  If other reviewers are complaining about low volume from this headset, it's likely because one of the two volume controls is turned down too low, or perhaps the mobile phone their using doesn't have much by way of signal output.  This Plantronics headset has *plenty* of loud volume if that's what you want.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for ear comfort, I found it to be very comfortable, although I haven't worn it all day long.  I talked to a friend for an hour yesterday, and I had absolutely no discomfort at all.  The device comes with three earpieces (small, medium and large).  I use the medium with great results.\n",
      "\n",
      "The phone fits snuggly on my ear and it doesn't move around at all, although I'm not jogging or even walking much while using it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like the more discreet look of having the \"guts\" of this device behind my ear, with a thin microphone on the side of my face, rather than the fat Motorola designs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other reviewers have cautioned about the headset breaking, so I just take very gentle care while handling it.  I suspect I won't have a problem with it falling apart.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't speak to battery life, because after a lengthy phone call, I just recharge it so it's ready for the next call I might make.  Charging it is easy to do and doesn't take long, either.\n",
      "\n",
      "In sum, I'm very satisfied with this device.  As long as it doesn't break, it's performance and comfortable design make this an excellent choice. Very good sounding both ways but not usable in 18 wheeler. Mic is overwhelmed by the 75 to 100db of ambient background noise. Good noise canceling in other environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not good outside in wind even with new mic grill. The Plantronics Voyager 510 BT headset is a great match with the LG VX8300. I tried the Plantronics Discovery 655 DSP and it was a HORRIBLE match with this phone. If you own the same cell phone that I own, then take my word---Voyager 510 is for you. Sound quality is just like using your phone itself. Pairing is very quick and simple. The over-the-ear design is a little more cumbersome than the Discovery 655, but I quickly got over that once I heard the clear, crisp sound. I've never written a review in my life, but I love this headset so much that I thought it was time I did. This was my first bluetooth headset after using wired headsets with my PPC 6700. With MS voice command, I just press the button and say \"call Rob at home\" or \"dial 206-343-xxxx\" or even \"play music\". I absolutely love it. It is lightweight, has long battery life, I can hear clearly, and other people can hear me clearly.  Range is about 25 feet, but I always have my phone in my pocket, so not a problem. I don't wear it unless I have a call, otherwise, I put it in my pocket, and haven't had any problems, it is very flexible. I've read some complaints about the buttons being too small, I have not found this to be a problem. Granted, the power button is small, but you only have to turn it on once in the morning. I'll have to admit though, I have small hands, persons with bigger paws might have an issue with this. I recommend this headset without hesitation. I really like the 510 headset. I have owned several. The sound quality is excellent. If you use Bluetooth headsets, consider this one. This is the best heaset yet for me having tried two other Motorola flavors. This headset is extremely comfortable in that often I actually forget I have it on. Performance is also great - Good noise/wind isolation with good clarity. I highly recommend the 510. My chihuahua rates this headset a 5 for flavor. Three so far. Apparently very, very tasty! This is my first cordless headset and it seems to be terrific.  I do occasionally have problems with coordination with the phone but that could be the phone or user issues.  For example, dialing a call expecting the sound to be through the headset and someone answers and I can't hear them.  I'm very impressed with the sound quality.  It is actually better than the phone in most cases.  The exception is outdoors in high winds. I wasn't sure if I wanted to purchase another bluetooth headset because the last one I purchased, a Motorola HS815, was terrible.  People were saying that they couldn't hear me or that there was too much static.  I figured it would be the same thing next time.  Boy was I wrong.  This headset is terrific.  I will give you some pros and cons:\n",

      "\n",
      "I would definitely recommend this item. I have had no issues. Sound quality and comfort are both good by me. Works very well with my phone's voice-activated dialing (a feature I'd never used, and never expected to). BEST BUY if you are looking for a professional looking Bluetooth Headset. No if's or but's.  I've been using this product for about 5 months now and love it.  Since then, I've suggested this product to several friends and familiy members and they love it as well.  Overall, with all the people combined, this product has been used on several different phones and so far it's worked seamlessly on every phone. If you wear a headset at work because of your work phone, you can buy the adapter which is about $100, and this 510 headset can be used at work as well.  Instructions are simple, easy to follow. Amazon's price was one of the lowest ($50). I would DEFINITELY buy this product again. After buying and trying a Blue Ant from Amazon and finding it would not fit in my ear and continually fell off my ear, I returned it.  I read the reviews about the 510 and one of the comments about wearing glasses and using this headset.  Now I have this and I love it!  With a choice of 3 ear buds, I have found one that fits and is comfortable.  I have no problem wearing this headset and my glasses.  The unit is light and comfortable, the incoming and outgoing sound is great.  I hear everyone clearly and they are impressed that I am speaking on a headset and not directly into the phone.  Highly recommend this headset. It is comfortable, stable on your ear, and very loud and clear sound quality.  There is only one other better Plantronics Bluetooth headset that is possessedly more advanced (655).  But I am extremely happy with this one, as it retails for about $50.  You can even buy aditional equipment and this headset can be used in your office or home with a regular land line as well.  Not only for cellular.  Awesome! Form factor does not compete with the super-tiny headsets out now, but I'll gladly sacrifice size for comfort and performance.  The clarity is amazing on both ends, I can wear it for hours at a time should I choose, and the wind deflection is fantastic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only drawback is that spiny on/off button which is a little sharp.  Other than that, there is not one complaint I have.  Not one. Although this is my first bluetooth headset, I've owned several regular headsets, and even without the wires this blows all the others away!  The sound is excellent, and doesn't suffer from a lot of the wind tunnel effect that you get on many other sets.\n",
      "\n",
      "PROS:\n",
      "\n",
      "* It's really nice to wear a bluetooth headset without looking like a cyborg.\n",
      "\n",
      "* The multiple sizes of earbuds are a nice touch, and make this headset so comfortable that I have almost forgotten to take it off.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Range is phenomenal!  I only have cell service in one part of my house, and I am able to leave my cell phone in that room and wander pretty freely from room to room with the headset on.\n",

      "* Buttons are small, forget operating with gloves on.  But if they were any bigger then your back to looking like one of the borg.\n",
      "\n",
      "* The STUPID flashing blue light!  I live in a fairly rural area, and when I'm driving down the road at night the light is so distracting that I've had to take it off.  You can cover it with tape or something, but who wants to do that to an otherwise attractive headset.  This particular niggle doesn't seem to be nearly as annoying in well lit environments, so it might not make a difference to some people. Easy to set up and use, excellent sound quality, light and comfortable.  You can't go wrong for the price. Excellent headset with my LG-VX8300. I've been using this headset for about 4 months.\n",
      "\n",
      " -Initially, it was very simple/fast to set it up with phone.\n",
      "\n",
      " -Folks I'm talking to say 'very clear on their end', and I have a very soft voice that does not carry - so this is a big win.\n",
      "\n",
      " -I can hear my callers exceptionally well, very clear.\n",
      "\n",

      " -The smart-multi-function button on the mike, the volume up/down toggle on the back of the earpiece, and the voice recognition program all work very well for me.\n",

      "I really, really like this headset - a lot of quality and sound design are very apparent, it does it's job very, very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons -\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Reception goes hissy at about 20 feet, not a problem for me as I generally carry my phone in a hip type holster, but noting here for others' info.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) The on/off switch on the headset is very small & stiff.  I have to remember to turn the headset on Before putting it on due I can't manage the on/off while the headset is on my ear. I can live with that given my great satisfaction with every other feature. Noting also that it took me a bit to figure out the on/off button is a 'slide forward to toggle' (i.e. is not a little push button).\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall - this is a very well designed, comfortable & headset, and I love it! I purchased this for my sister as a gift after reading many reviews for this and other bluetooth devices. I'm glad I did my homework, I was so surprised at the quality sound and comfortable fit. In fact so pleasantly surprised I purchased another for myself and love it. Once you use one that fits well and works properly you will wonder how you managed without it. This is my second headset replacing the Motorola one that came with my cell phone.  People I call tell me that the sound is very clear on their end and cannot tell that I am using the headset - sounds just like I am talking into the phone.  That was not the case with the first one. I travel a lot and wear the headset for long periods.  My ear does not get tired or sore from having it on.  The headset seems well balanced and never seems like it is going to fall off regardless of what I am doing.  I also like that it folds flat for easy carrying in my shirt pocket. I first bought a headset for $30.  It worked well for about 10 (maybe 12) minutes and then fell apart.  So, I would not suggest considering anything under $100.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unless you consider this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I returned my first headset to Fry's Electronics I asked them what their most popular model was.  The sales guy said it was the Plantronics 510.  I tried it on and it felt really good.  I've been using it for about two months now and I love it to pieces.  It works as well now as it did the moment I bought it (actually, better, because it needed a charging).\n",
      "\n",
      "Positives:\n",
      "\n",
      "1)  Comfort.  This was the biggest attribute I was looking for as I wear this a lot.  After putting it on I usually forget it is there within two minutes.  It is light weight and very easy on the ears.  I only remember when somebody calls me and I hear the beeping in my ears.  With a flick of the wrist, this easily converts between the left and right ear and both feel extremely comfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "2)  Sturdy.  I travel a lot and airports are not kind to any belongings, especially ones crammed into a bag.  But this thing has taken its lickings and keeps on going.  Must better than the first one I bought which fell apart over nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "3)  Great sound quality.  I've used this at airports, casinos, and convention centers.  I can always hear my party without any problems and I've never had anybody complain that they can't hear me.\n",
      "\n",
      "4)  Simple to work.  Probably the most difficult thing about this is getting it recognized by the phone.  And that isn't complicated at all as that only took me 2 minutes, and most of that was searching for directions on how to do it.  Picking up the phone is as easy as hitting a button.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a side note, I have two Bluetooth cellphones and I can switch between the two automatically without any hassle.  Because of this ease of switching over I am considering getting the phone base so I can use this on my office line at home as well.  I know somebody who uses it and she has no problems with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Negatives:\n",
      "\n",
      "1)  I wish there was a way to turn off the blinking blue light.  It drives me crazy especially while driving at night.  Half the times I see it blink I think  I'm getting pulled over.  Also, it keeps blinking whether you are using it or not so I usually cover it with a hand towel when it is charging at night.  But this seems to be inherent of any bluetooth device.\n",
      "\n",
      "2)  Ummmm.... I can't think of any other negatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I highly suggest checking this one out.  I can't say that this is for everybody because I've learned that no two ears are exactly alike.  The biggest thing I was looking for was comfort.  While this is completely comfortable for me it might not be for you.  But if you find it comfortable then I would HIGHLY recommend picking this up over anything else especially since the price is soooo right. I love it! The volume in the earpiece is so loud I had to turn it down halfway (that is a good thing!) The incoming sound is clear and everyone that talked to me said I was crystal clear. I am extremely pleased. I use between 3000 and 4000 cell minutes per month.  Heavy duty hands free is a necessity, not a luxury in this situation.  I needed an earpiece which has good battery life, easy to use, loud volume and clear to the person on the other end of the line.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Voyager 510 meets my needs.  I have used it for about a month and have recommended it to about 7 people who are in the process of purchasing it.  I may purchase a second unit as a spare or to use with my wifes phone (identical to mine, but used about 10 minutes per month).\n",
      "\n",
      "My Sony Erickson Walkman phone lacka a standard head set adapter, so Bluetooth was the only practical solution.  I read most of the reviews and tried several bluetooth from Plantronics, Motorola, and Sony.  I purchased and returned a mid range Motorola and the high end Plantronics. All except the high end Plantronics were barely audible and the Motorola was very hard on the person at the other end.  The Plantronics high end had good volume control, but it had a very poorly designed ear attachment and an equally hokey charger.  The high end Plantronics did have a barely noticable higher clarity on the other end in poor reception situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have found out by reading reviews, talking to users, talking to many sales people and by evaluating headsets that there is  A LOT OF HYPE FOR HEADSETS THAT JUST PLAIN DO NOT WORK.  So, if you want a low risk/high probability of satisfaction choice, the 510 may be the headset for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Voyager 510 is solidly build, has good volume, is clear on both ends has great battery life and is easily charged.  I can totally control the headpiece from the phone, so I never use the adjustment buttons on the headset except to answer/terminate calls and to power/depower the headset.  I have a Motorola bluetooth hands free speakerphone (also an Amazon purchase).  The Sony phone easily switched to which either the Voyager 510 or the Motorola speakerphone by simply pressing the \"answer call\" button on the desired headset. The 510 has greater clarity than the Motorola speakerphone, but the speakerphone works well for talking to relatives when my wife & I are driving.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, an unintendended, but appreciated, consequence of purchasing the 510 is the reasonable price.\n",
      "\n",
      "CONS.  I hate the flashing blue \"running lite\" which makes the user subject to looking like a major \"dork\".  I can actually use the lite to see my way around my house in total darkness.  I intend to put a small sleve over the light to silence it forever when I am wearing it.  The battery power is so good that when freshly charged, it always outlasts my phone, so a flashing blue light to tell the user that the unit has power is pretty lame.  Much better would be to iluminate the light whenever any button was depressed. This has got to be one of the greatest values out there.  I only paid $42 and got free shipping, what a deal.  This headset works outside in the wind.  My previous headset cost more, would not work in the slightest breeze, and it also fell apart after 2 months.  The Plantronics is obviously superior to many bluetooths costing twice as much.  The stiff on/off button is not a problem once you get used to it. Usually I don't have time to write reviews but this time I decided to do it simply to help others like me who tried many different headsets by Motorola and thought that probably there is nothing good on the market yet. I received  this one as a gift from my friend and love it for two simple reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) The sound quality is excellent. Despite the fact that it is very noisy in my car when I drive on the highway, I still can hear excellent. I actually do reduce volume on the headset because it has more volume potential than I need. I tried two headsets by Motorola in the past, including HS850. They also have volume button but even when you set to the maximum volume you can't hear well if you in a noisy environment. Plantronics provide you great quality and enough volume for any noisy environment. Also, everyone whom I talked to, told me that they can hear me very well, just like I speak without the headset.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Reason number two - it sits perfectly on the ear. It is easy to insert it when you drive, and once it in, it stays there. It doesn't move at all. Unlike Motorola headset, that does not fall off but it moves on your ear and it takes a long time to get used to the fact that it is not falling off your ear. Plantronics also provides three different sizes of the pieces that you insert to your ear, makes it perfect to fit any size or shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is all I have to say. There is a good headset out there. You don't need to wait any more. Over the last 2 years, I have tried over 10 different models of bluetooth headsets from different manufacturers. By far, Voyager 510 has the best all around performance - clarity, loudness, battery standby time, pairing, static free, ...\n",
      "\n",
      "If I have to pick one negative thing to say it would be the size.  It is quite a bit bigger than some other competing products but it is a small prize to pay for its superb performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Get one, you'll be glad that you do. I have small ears and sometimes have to use this gadget for 8 hour conference calls.  For this reason comfort and battery life are paramount.  It stays pretty comfortable and the battery will go about 4-6 hours.  I think that's about the most you can expect from a bluetooth headset. This is the third bluetooth headset I've had. This one is the best. The sound quality, the length of the charge, the fact that it \"plugs\" into your ear comfortably.  Absolutely the best one I have ever had. Buy it! I have used a number of Bluetooth Headsets, and I've been very impressed with the versatility, function and voice quality of this device. I have owned four Bluetooth headsets. This is by far the most comfortable and easiest to use. I have no problems with sore ears as with my other models (Motorola, Jabra BT350 and BT800) and sometimes forget that I am wearing it. Good sound quality, fits well, stays on no matter what. The perfect headset! In a world full of marketing hype it's always good to find something that works as advertised. The design of the Voyager 510 is well thought out. It's comfortable, but you still know it's there. For me that's a very good thing. I don't want it falling off only for me to realize it well after the fact. However, due to its great design I don't think it would fall off easily. Volume is excellent, once you're used to the controls they are excellent, clarity of what you hear as well as how others hear you is excellent. Overall solid purchase. I had a phone that had terrible BT reception so I purchased 3 other earpieces; the most expensive of these costing $129.  I went to a forum to see what others have done about this problem when I found out about the Voyager 510.  I must admit, this is the best BT on the market BY FAR.  It is truly comfortable, not just \"claimed\" to be.  I am on the phone quite a bit, and I have never run the battery down, the volume can be turned up louder than any of the other, and plugging the unit is easier than most of the others. This is a great unit. Having had the Motorolla HT850, I liked its light weight and ease to turn on but it was never loud enough for driving.  The Plantronics 510 is very loud and fits well. My only negative is the small power on switch.  All in all, I vote for the Plantronics I've tried several different Bluetooth headsets from Motorola and Cardo, and ended up returning or giving away all of them. I kept the Plantronics 510 because it is simply the best I have ever tried. I hear no static, cracks or pops, the audio quality is tops both for me and the caller, and it's comfortable and doesn't flop around on my ear like other headsets do when I move.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the Plantronics may seem slightly larger than other headsets (mainly because it has a larger part that goes behind the ear), it is very comfortable to wear and use, and is very light. It slips into a pocket or bag just as easily as any other Bluetooth headset.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Plantronics 510 comes with 3 different sizes of earbuds to fit your ear perfectly and the speaker goes in (or very close to) your ear, unlike other headsets where the speaker just rests on the outside of your ear which is really not good for getting high volume in windy/noisy environments.  Also the Plantronics has a boom mic that folds down partway towards your mouth. This is way better than headsets where the mic is way up by your ear because the closer the mic is to your mouth, the better you will sound and the less background noise the callers will hear. Everyone I've talked to using this Plantronics have raved at how good I sound, especially compared to the crappy Motorola's I've tried previously.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Voyager 510 has great battery life both while talking and on standby. The Bluetooth range is superb-I can very effectively walk all around my condo from room to room, talking on the phone, yet my cellphone remains on my computer desk-it really goes 30 feet, and through walls too.  And the fact that this headset can even remember pairing with multiple devices is icing on the cake.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really recommend this headset. It's money well spent. Or go ahead and try others, but it would be my educated guess that you will end up with this one eventually, like I did.\n",
      "\n",
      "*There is a slightly misleading bit of text in the instruction manual with regards to charging that you should be aware of: It states that the LED will illuminate Red while charging and illuminate Blue when done charging. However it actually blinks red while charging and turns solid Blue when complete. I've used a handful of handsfree devices and this one by far outshines them all.  Now, its not to say that it's perfect, but with the online price being around $50-$60 shipped, it's a steal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "\n",
      "Without reading more than a quick line about setting the headset up for device pairing - the headset connected effortlessly w/ my Samsung A920.  I've never had a connectivity issue with these two devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most headsets - wired included - suffer from low max volume from the speaker - not this one. I've found myself having to turn the headset down a couple of notches because it is that loud.  The sound is crystal clear as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although it looks a tad bit bulky - it is very comfortable.  It just fits.  The fact that they offer three different size ear pieces is a testiment to Plantronic's emphasis on customer satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really dig the look of it too.  It's bold, yet understated.  It looks like a device that serves a purpose - not like some cheesy colored clip on that looks like it was designed for the highschool fashion runway.  It looks functionally high tech.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons: The power button is really small... but even w/ that con, there is a pro behind it - being that it isn't easily powered off makes it less likely to be accidentally shut off during either a call or when it's being carried in your pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all I give it extremely high marks for a truely exceptional device.\n",
      "\n",
      "disclaimer:  I bought the new black and silver headset (version G).  I can't attest for the grey and silver (version A) but I'm sure it is also a quality product. Well, I figured that I might as well write a short review here for the 510 headset. I've had it for 5 months or so, and it's been great! I've had no problems with it, and I am happy that I listened to the advice from the people here on Amazon.\n",
      "\n",
      "My conclusion: After reading other reviews for wireless bluetooth headsets, and using this one, there is no better option than getting this one if you can. You will not regret it! Reader,\n",
      "\n",
      "I've had Sony Ericsson, Logitech Mobile Freedom, Cario Scala 500, Plantronics Discovery 640, and finally this Voyager 510.  Let me just say that my prior favorite was the Logitech but it was a little bulky and it disconnected from my phone after most calls (annoying).\n",
      "\n",
      "Having said that I now enjoy Plantronics Voyager 510.  The higher model, Discovery 640 doesn't stand a chance.  Yes the 640 is smaller, cooler-looking, but the features are not good.  The 640 has no windguard, no noice-cancelling tech, and the talk time is short.  The extra battery charger they give you and try to say that it boosts talk time does not.  You can't talk and charge at the same time.  Sheesh.\n",
      "\n",
      "OKay, so now with the Voyager 510, I love it.  Great fit.  It seems Plantronics has come out with a new version of the 510.  The foam mic boom is not removeable but is built in much like the logitech is.  The voice and sound quality are top notch.  I've recorded myself and it sounds clear.  I can even notice a difference with the noise-cancelling technology as the tv was on in the background, but my voice was still clear.  Noice-cancelling is important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "\n",
      "Clear, audible sound\n",
      "\n",
      "Mic is sensitive and my voice for callers are clear\n",
      "\n",
      "Wind-Guard\n",
      "\n",
      "Noise-Cancelling technology (must have!)\n",
      "\n",
      "Fit - stays on confortably and they give 3 earphone-like inserts (perfect)\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "\n",
      "the only thing is that the mic boom seems to rub up on my cheek or is very close so sometimes it will make a scratching sound for the caller (since it's rubbing against my cheek).  I haven't heard that complaint from other reviewers here so maybe it's unique to me.  I don't have big cheeks so I don't get it. The Plantronics 510 is comfortable to wear for hours and doesn't feel like it will fall off your ear.  It mates easily to my Treo 650 and also to my Bluetooth-enable laptop, which makes it possible to use the laptop for VoIP calls.  Reception is good, volume is adequate and the people I talk with say that my voice is clear.  The controls are a bit stiff, as others have said.  But that means they have good tactile feedback -- you know when you've pressed a button.\n",
      "\n",
      "One marginal shortcoming: the 510's clarity isn't good enough for it to replace the wired Plantronics USB headset I use for dictating to Dragon Systems \"Naturally Speaking\" voice recognition software on the laptop.  But that would be a stretch for any wireless headset.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prices vary widely; shop around. I've used this headset for 5 months now. It comes with a variety of ear tips to help fit your ear. Spend some time with each of them to find the most comfortable. Note that with the non-round ones that you can insert them in 2 directions and no one's ears are the same. The tips can be inserted 180 degrees opposite, then you still get the extra rotating \"play\" they leave you to fine tune it after inserting. I ended up staying with the round one, which is comfortable and yields the flexibility of use on either ear, although I almost always wear it on the same side. I have nearly forgotten it is there and worn it for many hours straight with no discomfort. I will never go back to holding a phone to my head again. When I had a wired headset, I would only ever put it on when I was going to be in the car for a while; it stayed in the car. Now, if I'm not already wearing my headset, I will answer a ringing call with my phone only long enough to get out the headset and punch the button to bring the call to it. My wife thinks I'm weird for putting on the headset to make a call when I have to get my phone out to dial a number anyway (and actually the voice calling works really well on the Samsung!). The fact is that it is so much better sound and more convenient than holding a phone to the side of your head.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have paired it with my Samsung SCH-i730, a Zonet BlueTooth USB Adapter (for game talk via Ventrilo / TeamSpeak), and a cheapo BT phone base station that lets it function with the phone line at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I talk too softly, others can't hear me, but I can talk much softer with the headset than when I hold the phone to my head, so it's better than my phone's microphone. It is not the most sensitive microphone compared with the wired professional desk phone headsets at work, but it is one of the best rated for noice cancellation so being able to use it in a noisier environment is priceless. If I have to say something quietly that I don't want nearby people to hear, then I can just cup my hand to one side of my mouth and it directs my voice straight back towards the headset. With this headset, you won't be the jerk standing around yelling on a phone call (but if you are, I hope you get punched!)\n",
      "\n",
      "Quality of sound is great. I only notice stutter (some people call it static but it's a stutter not a hiss) if I get a wall or two or about 25 feet of clear space away from my Samsung. If my phone is charging in my car, I will just set the phone up on my dash and run into a store to get a refill and not lose the signal while I'm inside. Sometimes if certain things touch against the BT antenna part of my phone, I will hear a little stutter. I just move my arm or whatever it was away from the spot and all is well again. The funny thing is, I can't purposely cause this when I try to cover my phone with my hand or arm; it is only in certain circumstances as if it has to do with the wireless signal bouncing around just right to cause stutter.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found I could usually go 2-3 days between charges with my casual cell phone use (~20 min a day?). If you are a heavy cell user, expect about 3-4 hours of talk time in 1 day. If you need more you will have to charge this thing halfway through the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I started using it with Ventrilo and TeamSpeak, I had to start charging it on my way home from work, as it would only last about 3 hours of talk time after being in standby all day. I have some very good wired headsets for the computer, that I used to use for Internet chatting, but all of them pick up breathing \"wind\" from my nose. I never noticed that in a conversation with someone, but for gaming you sit and wear it while you're quiet a lot. You want to have it transmit when you talk but not when you sit and breathe. This headset sounds many times better than the wired ones, and does not pick up breathing or background noises unless the speakers get turned up too loud.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered a Plantronics USB charger cable, belt clip carry pouch, and an extra pack of eartips from HeadsetZone for a great price. I am not sure if I'd recommend the belt clip if you would tend to lose the headset out of it from a brush against anything that would catch on it. The belt clip leaves about a third of the headset exposed; it's more of a pocket than a case and has nothing but slight friction to keep the headset in it. I almost always have my shirt untucked but I still have to check the headset on my belt often to make sure it isn't falling out. If this concerns you then find something that has a velcro or snapping cover. I already owned a Cigarette-to-USB-power plug, which comes in handy for many USB devices in the car, including the charger cable. I have never had a Bluetooth headset before the 510.  I use it with a Motorola i870 Nextel phone.  The headset works great, sometimes it disconnects for a moment and I just press the button on the side of the headset and it reconnects.  The talk time is awesome and I have gotten almost 5 hours continuous talk time out of the device.  The range isn't too bad I think I can get about 30 feet from my i870.  If only my crappy Nextel phone could keep up will the quality of the headset.  Since my i870 battery goes dead in like 1 1/2 with the extended batter pack I have to plug it in to charge.  However, while it's plugged in I can still use the 510 and wander all over the house and still talk on the phone.  It almost replaces the phone if I could dial from it.  The best part is that when you get too far away it gets a little static so that you know to come back closer and then the sound quality clears up.  Everyone I have spoken with on the headset says it sounds very nice and clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall I would suggest this headset to anyone because it works, it's cheap and it wears extremely comfortable on your ear. I was steered toward Plantronics by a friend.  He was definitely right.  Very clear, easy to use, comfortable, compact, qick charge time, and great battery life.  One tip - I didn't know for a while, but your volume control on your BlackBerry itself will raise and lower the volume on the headset.  If your phone supports bluetooth, you have to get a headset.  There is no contest between this and a wired headset - in sound quality or usage.  And the Plantronics is a great choice.  I have only used another(Motorola), and this seems to keep a better battery charge and the headset is much more comfortable.  You have to remember you have it on sometimes or you walk into a meeting looking foolish. This headset proved to be a very pleasant surprised after trying\n",
      "\n",
      "a bunch of others.  Was definitely the most comfortable, had\n",
      "\n",
      "great sound and actually fits in your ear.  Variable ear pieces\n",
      "\n",
      "are a great touch and this unit should fit larger ears better.\n",

      "Sound quality was very good.  Only downside is slightly hard\n",
      "\n",
      "to manipulate buttons.  But this is minor.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you've tried a bunch and can't get a good fit, try this one,\n",
      "\n",
      "it'll probably work - did for me. Pros: small, not protruding like others, lightweight and comfortable. Batter last too long...lol, mic quality is great. twist sorta flat for storage in pocket etc. Multi-Link is great\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons: Sometimes volume could be louder in noisy environments, easy to lose the foam mic cover. buttons are hard to press (on/off) but not too bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know how I lived without this. I can link it up with my wife's phone and my phone at the same time, or my laptop and phone. I use Skype and other microphone based programs on my laptop, and I can play (listen & talk) in online games, talk via Skype and still have it linked to my cell phone at the same time. Very very handy. If you multitask frequently I definately recommend this headset! I've paired this unit with a Motorola V551 and it works wonderfully.  The sound is great on both ends (my wife cannot tell I'm on a headset of any kind).  The battery life is very good.  The set fits my ear well and doesn't move once in position.\n",
      "\n",
      "The controls are ok contrary to some of the other reviews here.  The only tricky control is the power button which isn't difficult to access once you take the unit off of your ear. That's correct, for men! This headset is heavier then most but the sounds quality is excellent and most importantly it can be VERY LOUD! Most other Bluetooth headsets that I've tried have issues with volume level. They are not loud enough (Motorola, Logitech and Jabra) especially in a car drive fast. But be aware, it's on the heavy side for many. It's perfect for me but I am almost 6 feet tall and weight close to 230 lbs. I would not recommend it for most ladies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the noise cancellation is good; people on the other side can hear me very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Battery life is excellent; I estimate about 5 hours maybe 6.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drawbacks are:\n",
      "* It does not have a USB re-charger like some\n",
      "* The mute and off/on button is too small. Basically so small that it's useless. But then my phone has a mute button\n",
      "* It's heavier then most (not as heavy as Jabra though) This little guy is just amazing. This is my first Bluetooth headset- and the first headset of any kind I've ever regularly used with my phone (I never could stand those corded ones). I bought it primarily for when I'm in the car, but now I find myself using it all the time, and finding out how many wonderful times it comes in handy. Talking to a friend who wanted someone's number, I was able to go through my phone address book while still talking to him. And being able to roam around the house, or use the computer without getting a neck cramp is priceless. As for this specific model- it works very well, and as advertised. Battery life has been just great, as is reception. It's small and light enough that I soon forget I have it on, and can keep it on pretty much all day. My only complaint is that it doesn't fold up all that well to go in a pocket, etc. But I guess if it did, then it probably wouldn't be very comfortable to wear, so I can't really fault it for that. I don't think I will ever have a phone again without one of these guys nearby. I am very happy with this purchase Use them until AT&T dropped service. worked very well excellent!! it is work well,  good designer, I like it Excellent great cell phone Excellent product Great phone.. Like all Motorola devices, I sent to my sister in Cuba to keep Good comunication Works great! Good! excelent gracias excellent this was for my oldest son and he is still using it. it is an international phone and he loves it excelente Best cellphone....of course, keeping distance between our age, but i feel this product was revolutionary at his time; light and easy to use Very Good Job , Thanks very much Very Good Job , Thanks very much  Very Good Job , Thanks very much My dad's cellphone broke, so he wanted the same phone since he's used to the software of the phone and the phone itself. My dad loved the cellphone. I needed a cheap but decent quad-band GSM phone for travel.  This is has worked very well for me travelling in the Czech Republic.  I just bought a Vodophone SIM card for around $10 USD when I arrived (the full amount was credited for phone usage) popped it in and it worked great.  The thin size is kind of nice and the text messaging is adequate. I was tired of my Nokia E62 and its multifunctions and relatively high weight. I decided to buy a simple, not do-all cellular phone. I went back in time and I ordered a new Motorola V3 and was pleased to receive a brand new phone with a new battery. Delivery on time as promised. I thought to come write this review because it is the 2 year anniversary of me buying this phone. I have never had any protective cover or case on it and it is still not very scratched up and it works as perfectly as when I got it. I had to replace the battery at 18 months but it cost $10 with shipping online for a genuine Motorola battery. Every other cell phone I have had has broken in some way long before 2 years. I'm amazed it is still in such great cosmetic and mechanical shape. No reason for me to get a new phone anytime soon. I bought this RAZR v3 phone in July to go with my 7-Eleven Speak Out Wireless prepaid service.  The phone I received from Amazon.com was made for the Hong Kong market, so it came with a outlet plug adapter for U.S. customers.  (The AC adapter itself is universal voltage, and the slim paper manual is in English.)  The phone is quadband and fully unlocked, so it can be used anywhere in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really like the RAZR phone.  It's very solid and the voice quality is excellent.  Speak Out Wireless runs on AT&T and T-Mobile networks so the reception quality can vary, but overall the RAZR does an excellent job in pulling in as much signal as possible.  As with other Moto phones, the brightness of the screen can be adjusted, and the ringer type and volume can be easily changed.  The metallic keypad takes a little getting used to, but is pretty comfy to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "The camera is only VGA but takes good-quality pictures when there's plenty of light.  Video capture is jerky and limited to 15 seconds, so that's probably the weakest feature for me.  Bluetooth linkup to a Sony Ericsson earpiece works fine.  Battery life is admirable; I don't use the phone much, maybe just 10 minutes a week, and I need to recharge it once every 8 days or so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because I've owned many Moto's before so I like the RAZR's interface, since it feels familiar, but I can understand how it can confuse users new to the Moto scene.  Overall, though, I don't think it's harder to use than a Sony or Nokia.\n",
      "\n",
      "What really impresses me is the build quality of this phone.  Nowhere can you find out where this thing is made, but the material and fit and finish are excellent.  I'm very happy with this inexpensive purchase. Have owned two in the past two years and my daughter has another one.  Reliable, inexpensive, practical, easy to use.  Tons of accesories and add-ons.  One of the best, if not the best, Motorola has ever made. This RAZR phone is nicely sized and easy to use.  It is not quite as comfortable of a fit on my ear as my old StarTac, but I'm sure I'll get used to it.  Buying an unlocked GSM Quad band phone offers the ability to travel out of the country and connect in to their networks at very reasonable per minute rates.  Also allows you to access stateside or overseas service without long-term contracts (e.g. monthly or prepaid). Although almost of the entire world is using GSM technology, not all US carriers are GSM.  Surely, T-Mobile and Cingular/AT&T are GSM and there may be a few others. I would make this purchase again. This is my fourth consecutive Motorola phone. I've owned a Timeport, v66, and v600. The Timeport was simply terrible. The v66 was a little better, but the Motorola menu had to be the worst of any phone I had ever used. My v600 was a very pleasant surprise. My sleek and functional RAZR is the best phone that I have owned. I really like the large crisp screen. The tiny external screen is a great addition. After three weeks of fairly heavy use, I haven't had any problems. The RAZR has pretty good talk time, but I'm not certain whether or not one can really get the 7 hours claimed by Motorola. The feature that I really like and appreciate is the abilit to charge my phone with a standard USB cable. It's nice not having to carry around an extra charger when I'm already lugging around my laptop and its power supply. You get exactly what you might expect: a spare cable.  I like to keep this with my travel ket so that I can use the cable when I'm not at home where I use a Palm cradle. I was very, very pleased with this purchase.  The connector was what I thought is was, the price was outstanding, and the shipping was quick.  Very positive experience. This is a very durable charger/sync cord! Works great for both. I've had it for about two weeks and it's great! I recommend it very much The range and clarity was amazing when I got to hear them being used.  They are really loud and have a high quality of sound. This thing is the bomb. Setup takes about 5 minutes, and it's easy to break back down if you're wanting to take it with you somewhere. It's lightweight enough to be easily movable, but also heavy enough that it hasn't blown over even during windstorms. So nice to be able to practice putting whenever I want! Very sturdy. Not made out of cheap material. Is still standing after most of the storms that we have. Serves it's purpose very well. I would buy it again if I need another one.  Bought this for my husband for his birthday. Our 5 year old son loves to play as well now. Delivered as promised. It is a good basket for practice, quick set up, but 14 chains I have thrown discss through that at the course would have stayed.  But after looking at reviews and the other portable baskets I like this one and the price is very reasonable.  Recommend it, seems sturdy and should last a long time.  Nice to practice in the evenings after work. After being completely disappointed with Motorola HS850 (see my review), got myself a brand new model of Jabra - BT500 and love it. I use is with Motorola V620 (V600 European model). Volume is perfect, sits comfortably on my ear, and does not fall even if I shake my head, people hear me without any problems and distance is good as well. Charges fast and battery last long. Have no problems with echoes or anything else. Buttons are very easy to access and respond right away. I would recommend this one to anyone. Very easy to use, versatile, & very good price.  Has been superceded with newer product, but jabra has been just as good with other products also. Have only had one other bluetooth headset, which was ok except it always felt like it was about to fall off.  This one fits well for both me and my wife.  (bought one for me too)  Also it's not nearly so obvious looking.  Voice quality, both incoming and outgoing is great. Very comfortable to wear, good reception, price of ~$22 plus shipping was unreal.  I prefer this style over the Star Trek earpieces, but this one's boom mic extends further out from the ear than other models in this series. I had a Motorola headset, and it felt heavy and hurt my ear.  I had complaints from my callers that they could hear static.  This BT500 is lightweight, fits perfectly, and the volume and on/off button are rubberized and very easy to find and use.  This isn't even in the same ballpark as my other headset. I could wear this one for hours.  I am petite, and it fit perfectly.  The unit came with several earpieces, so you can find the perfect fit.  I LOVE IT! I bought this as a replacement to a JX10 because I wanted to be able to use all the Jabra charger cords I had amassed over the years. This headset works perfect. Battery life is outstanding (I have never had this thing die and usually leave it on all day). Reception is of course dependent on what phone you are using it with. I am using a Blackberry Curve on T-Mobile, and am very satisfied with every aspect of this headset. Your first question is what other headsets am I comparing this to. See my reviews of the Motorola HS850, Jabra BT250v, Plantronics 320 Explorer for reference. Now let's consider this headset in terms of the four key performance categories: pairing, sound quality, ease of use, and comfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pairing - I was able to pair this headset with my LG VX-9800 on the first try. The instructions in the manual are straightforward so I will not repeat them hear. The experience is similar to what I had with the BT250v.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sound Quality - This is really the top area to question with a headset. I'm happy to report that this headset delivers nicely in this area. I am able to use less than the max volume setting in most cases which is definite progress over the other headsets I have used. On the other end, it is important that you don't have the volume louder than you need it because otherwise people hear an echo of themselves due to the close proximity of the speaker to the microphone. However, I have found the echo to be less of an issue than it is on the HS850.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ease of Use - The key to a Jabra headset is holding the multifunction button down until it flashes. This turns the headset on and off after pairing. You will hear reports of people winding up redialing the last number called when trying to turn the headset off. If you don't wait for the flash, this will happen. I've also heard this reported during pairing, but that shouldn't be the case because you start pairing with the headset turned off. Finally, the volume buttons are easy to use. I only use the headset on my right ear so I can't speak to what it is like when the headset is flipped over and the buttons are on top.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comfort - I also found this headset to be the clear winner in the area over the other three that I have used. I wear glasses so the over the ear hook is a necessity. I think that they have also hit the sweet spot on placement of the speaker. The speaker is raised from the surface of the headset as opposed to the HS850 which is flush with the main body of the headset. However, it does not go into your ear like the BT250v or the Plantronics 320. I guess another way to put it is it rests just outside of the ear canal so the speaker is as close to being inside your ear without actually being so. I think that this maximizes comfort and contributes to the better sound quality. Finally, the vibrate feature is very disturbing if you are not used to it. Don't let that stop you though because it is something that you can turn off if you so desire. Your first question is what other headsets am I comparing this to.

I personally think the Black Edition RAZR phone looks really cool, better than the regular silver version.  The phone is otherwise identical to its silver twin... but, really, it just looks so cool -- and you'll differentiate yourself from The Crowd.\n",
      "\n",
      "The phone is very capable and packed with features.  Unlike some high-end Moto phones from a year or two back, this one works very well and has a decent interface.  Everyone I know who has this phone simply loves it.\n",
      "\n",
      "[...] The RAZR isn't the white-hot pay-through-the-nose product that it once was, and other ultra-thin phones have come out since, but the titanium casing is still the standard for fashion, and the black is just timeless.  Add to that the price of a big fat $0 with a Cingular contract when you order through Wirefly, and what's not to like? I bought this phone ofr my in-laws a few months ago and it works great.  Unfortunately, I don't get to see their phone very often.  Unless there is something better, this will be my next phone. One person said in a review \"While this phone is thin, it is too bulky to handle, and seems flimsy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I could not disagree more. It feels extremly sturdy, and while it is not a tiny phone, it is very thin. It weighs more then you would expect, but I don't mind because it feels a bit more well made.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had an off version of the Motorola V557 that I have had for well over a year now. I got it free, so I gave it up to a friend who needed a phone badly. I am a cingular customer. I was wanting a new phone anyways and it worked out well.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got the Nokia 6102 about one or two weeks ago. I have to say while it is a good deal for the price I just didn't like it at all. So I returned it and got the razr. I spent a bit more on the razr, but it was reasonable. (...).\n",
      "\n",
      "The razor is simple phone, a good phone. It comes in a very pretty case that will make you happy each and every time you open it! It has a good quality camera (it's NOT a digital camera, its more like good quality web cam) and I find it very easy to read, and dial because everything is so clear and spaced out nicley.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got the black version, and I nick named it KIT after the night rider car, it reminds me of it. Yeah I am a dork!\n",
      "\n",
      "I had read some complaints that this phone didn't come with enough stuff, well at it's launch price point I would say yeah it was overpriced. Now it has come down and it is a good deal in my book.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am very pleased with it so far! Pleased enough to come write a review!\n",
      "\n",
      "I also love all the cool accessories you can get, including vynle(sp?) skins in any color you want. worked fine.  Easy set up and worked with the magnetic cartridge in my Turntable perfectly I purchased this with my Pro-Ject Debut Carbon turntable and am very happy with it. It's a cinch to setup (don't forget to ground!) and the company got it out to me long before the estimated arrival - I believe I received it in only 3 days. Purchased this to bring my albums back to life and to be able to use my old Pioneer PL X300 with my Harman Kardon receiver. Matched with some good quality RCA Audio cables and man I can not believe the sound!! I swear my albums sound better than there cd counterparts. Anyways the Preamp works perfectly, seems very well built and at a very good price. I am very happy with my purchase and can highly recommend it. I actually needed to contact them due to a sound issue with my left channel.  He had me shut off all the DSP additives on my Harman Kardon receiver and BAM!!! perfection!!! The Doors Alive She Cried never sounded so good!!!!!  Make sure to set your receiver to 2 Channel stereo all DSP off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rock On!!!! While its not your super inflated priced audiophile preamp it has good response and good sound to feed into your amplifier. There are more expensive preamps out there, but this one does it's job well and I haven't had any complaints or odd noise coming through it. Great for the money. I needed to replace my old surround sound stereo because it lacked HDMI inputs so I put it to use as my audio stereo only problem was no input for a turntable which is why I bought this phono pre-amp. It was very easy to hook up and have noticed no difference in sound than with my old receiver which had a dedicated phono input. Its small enough to sit on top of my receiver while in the cabinet so its out of sight. Its getting harder to find stereos with phono inputs and for those of you that already have a surround system without a phono input this is a good solution. You can spend alot more on one of these and maybe the audiophiles of the world can hear the difference but for the casual listener this should work fine. Audiophiles will snub the little TC750, thinking something so cheap can't be worth serious attention.  The truth is that this little unit has a fine, uncolored sound.  The TC750's specs are nothing the sneeze at either:  S/N ratio greater than 85dB, less than .05% THD, and frequency response +/- .5dB from 20Hz - 20KHz.  Shockingly good numbers from such a modestly priced unit.  It's easy to disbelieve such numbers at such a low price, but my ears say it's true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be sure to check out the range of preamps this company offers before you buy.  They have several models with different features.  Different versions have level controls, extra inputs or ability to work with moving coil cartridges.  You can probably get the exact thing you need.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one downside is that the AC adapters are prone to failure.  Phonopreamps.com seems to know this, since their lifetime warranty on the preamp excludes the adapter, which is instead warranted for 60 days.  Expect to make a trip to RadioShack for a new AC adapter in 6 months to a year. Easy set up for my Mac Mini coupled with CD Spin Doctor (part of Toast software). This is what you want if your receiver does not have phono input.\n",
      "No noise at all. Good sound. I was considering the purchase of a USB turntable to archive some of my old vinyl. Then I thought .. HEY !! I haver a Creative Labs X-FI Platinum card and software out the wazoo for this kind of thing.  I also have a variety of high-end amps, mixers, etc. but always ended up with weak signals or horrendous buzzes when I tried to capture disk to digital.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my frustration, I looked at eBay for a phono pre-amp, but was not impressed with the affordable options.  My next step, when eBay doesn't pan out (OFTEN)is to look at new stuff on Amazon (which ALWAYS comes through.)\n",
      "\n",
      "As typical with Amazon buys, this showed up at my doorstep nearly INSTANTANEOUSLY !!  At least, I ordered like midnight on Thursday, and it was here before noon Monday !!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "I hooked it up in a few second (but realized the GROUNDING WIRE is key to killing the hum).  Apparently a lot of units in this price range omit this ESSENTIAL feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "My first record recorded like a DREAM !!!  All the warmth of vinyl (minus the hiss and pops).  The end result is better than the original.  I produced a Jazz album back in the '80s and have been trying to find a way to get the originals of the BETA VH-1 tapes.  Now I don't need to worry.  The original master disks from vinyl sound better than the the digital masters to my ears.)  I may just re-release it on CD this way.\n",
      "\n",
      "WELL worth the low price, and as I've experienced with Amazon before, my expectations were far exceeded.  Kudos to both companies !! Thank You! love this case fit my phone perfect and of course my favorite color I wanted a good protective case to bring along my older \"retired\" iPhone 4 on trips as an emergency backup-- in case my current iPhone 6 is ever lost or disabled, the older iphone still has all my Address Book contacts and works on Wifi for email, internet etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "This one does the job just fine. The 'notebook' design gives decent screen protection inside my travel bag, and the magnet clasp holds it securely closed. There's a detachable vinyl-stitched matching Lanyard which is also handy.\n",
      "\n",
      "This type of cover is a proven design, with no surprises. It's stiff enough and lightly padded and gives pretty good protection. I have it in the Blue trim version. It looks exactly like the Amazon photos.\n",
      "\n",
      "I agreed to accept a sample for testing and impartial consumer review. I'm genuinely pleased with this, and my iphone 4 lives in this case from now on. Nothing I can think of that I would change, and overall I'm pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope this is helpful as you comparison shop online. Happy travels, everybody. Great price fast shipping fits my phone great love the belt clip I got this for my sons Motorola when we were looking for a longer charge battery. We found it here for the best price and it fits perfectly without problems. What a terrific phone Motorola developed!!!! Its heads and shoulders above NOK, Samsung, sony/ericy etc. I really like my T-Mobile service, however, the only downside is the price for the phone. My wife was able to get one much cheaper through a different service we both do not like as much as T-mobile. Take amazons offer and you will be happy with this phone, or wait and see if it will be free a little later, which is what im doing since i have the service already......\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE---After using the phone for several months now there is some good and bad. The good is the size which makes it easy just to put in my pocket no more hangning it on my side. I like the big screen, the golf game is fun and the background screen feature is great to display family members. There are plenty of different ring tones and is nice to be able to place different rings to different callers, also, the ringer is good and loud and with vibrate and it in my pocket i don't miss a call. The camera is good quality and i can take descent pictures in low light unlike my previous nokia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Negatives--If there is any noise or wind at all other than typical sound in a room its very very hard to hear and difficult to place the phone in the \"sweet\" spot to hear the call.  If its sunny forget about seeing the screen unless ya find shade. My ring settings keep getting changed as i go to open the phone and hit the buttons on the side of the phone changing ring setting, frustrating....\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with the negatives i would buy again or get it for free is better due to the slim design and ease of putting in the pocket thats a big positive to me and the large screen is nice when i can see it. I got this phone for mother's day from my husband, and it's great. It takes wonderful pictures when you forget your real camera at home. I took pictures of our daughter in the hospital, and it takes great in-door shots so her daddy could see how she was doing. My husband was thrilled to see the photos I took. The phone works great and since we live so far up north in the Redwood forests, we get clear, perfect reception. I was so thrilled with this new phone, I love it and take it everywhere. Comes with several fun things to add to the phone too. Try one out, you'll love it too. I haven't had anything go wrong yet,and I've dropped it a few times, with nothing breaking. I have the silver one, it's thin, comfortable to hold, and easy to dial, without trying not to hit other buttons in the process. My friends all want one too! So far, this is the best phone yet.\n",
